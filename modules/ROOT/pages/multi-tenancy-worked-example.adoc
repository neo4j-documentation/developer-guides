.Prerequisites
[abstract]
Please have link:/download[Neo4j^] (version 4.0 or later) downloaded and installed.
It helps to have read the section on link:/developer/in-production/manage-multiple-databases/[managing multiple databases].
We'll also need to install https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-apoc/[APOC^], Neo4j's standard library.

[#multi-tenancy]
In Neo4j (v4.0+), we can create and use more than one active database at the same time.
This works in standalone and causal cluster scenarios and allows us to maintain multiple, separate graphs in one installation.

In this guide we're going to learn how to use this feature with a multi tenant dataset.

[#setup-db]
== System setup

If you haven't already, link:/download/[download^] Neo4j.

We will need to have a database running and open link:/developer/neo4j-browser/[Neo4j Browser] to walk through this guide.
If you are unsure how to create and start a database, step-by-step instructions for doing so in Neo4j Desktop are provided in link:/developer/neo4j-desktop[this guide].

We're going to use the APOC Library in this guide, and in order to process local files, we'll need need to add the following entry to the `apoc.conf` file:

.apoc.conf
[source,properties]
----
apoc.import.file.enabled=true
----

We'll also be using https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/introduction/[Neo4j Fabric^], which we can enable by adding the following properties in the `neo4j.conf` file:

.neo4j.conf
[source,properties]
----
fabric.database.name=fabric

fabric.graph.0.name=mall1
fabric.graph.0.uri=neo4j://localhost:7687
fabric.graph.0.database=mall1

fabric.graph.1.name=mall2
fabric.graph.1.uri=neo4j://localhost:7687
fabric.graph.1.database=mall2
----

[#carrefour-retail-dataset]
== Carrefour Retail dataset

We're going to use a dataset published by Carrefour, a French retailer, as part of their https://github.com/ging/carrefour_basket_data_challenge[Delighting Customers Challenge Basket Data^].
Rik van Bruggen recently wrote a series of blog posts showing how to import and analyse this data in Neo4j 3.5.

The data is available as https://drive.google.com/a/neotechnology.com/uc?id=1wDNAMFk_3-H1l44ID4P6fcE6K7cvG9iX&export=download[a JSON file^] curated by Rik.
Once we've downloaded the file, we need to put it into the `import` folder of Neo4j.

The dataset is accompanied by a data dictionary that describes each of the fields that we see in the file:

.Data Dictionary
[opts="header", cols="1,3"]
|===
| Field | Description
| id |     Number id for that individual ticket.
| mall |   Store where the ticket was printed. It has two values, 1 and 2.
| data  |  Date and time the ticket was printed.
| client | Some tickets will have a Customer ID. Many tickets will share a Customer ID.
| items  | List of items contained in the printed ticket. The list contains a dictionary with a product description (desc), the amount charged (net_am), and the number of units bought (n_unit).
|===

From looking at these descriptions, `mall` seems like a good property to use to partition the data.
We can store the tickets printed in mall 1 in one database, and the tickets printed in mall 2 in another database.


[#exploring-data]
== Exploring the data

We can now process this file using the `apoc.load.json` procedure.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.json("file:///DelightingCustomersBDclean.json")
YIELD value
RETURN value
LIMIT 5;
----

| {date: "2016-01-14T14:25:00.000+0000", client: 77021708271, _id: 1005, items: [{n_unit: 1, net_am: 3.9, desc: "PAQUETE 500 HOJAS A4"}, {n_unit: 1, net_am: 4.99, desc: "LEGGING NINA 3/14"}, {n_unit: 1, net_am: 9.99, desc: "JERSEY UNISEX 3/14"}, {n_unit: 3, net_am: 4.6, desc: "HUESITOS LECHE 12"}, {n_unit: 1, net_am: 2.65, desc: "MINI FUET CAMPOFRIO"}, {n_unit: 2, net_am: 2.78, desc: "REGAÑA ACEITE OLIV"}, {n_unit: 1, net_am: 15.95, desc: "MEGA MAKI"}], mall: 1}
|===

We can see that some items are from mall 1 and some from mall 2.
Let's have a look how many tickets each mall printed:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.json("file:///DelightingCustomersBDclean.json")
YIELD value
RETURN value.mall, count(*)
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| value.mall | count(*)
| 2 | 293586
| 1 | 292893
|===

It looks like we'll have two quite evenly populated databases.
Let's get those databases created!

[#creating-databases]
== Creating databases

We're going to store the data for each mall in a different Neo4j database.
We'll create these databases using the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.0/administration/databases/#administration-databases-create-database[`CREATE DATABASE`^] command, which we need to run against the `system` database.
Let's first switch to that database:

[source,cypher.fragment]
----
:use system;
----

Once we've done that we can run the following statements to create the databases:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE mall1;
CREATE DATABASE mall2;
----

We can check that those databases have been created by running the following command:

[source,cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES;
----

.SHOW DATABASES
[opts="header"]
|===
| name     | address        | role         | requestedStatus | currentStatus | error | default
| "neo4j"  | "0.0.0.0:7687" | "standalone" | "online"        | "online"      | ""    | TRUE
| "system" | "0.0.0.0:7687" | "standalone" | "online"        | "online"      | ""    | FALSE
| "fabric" | "0.0.0.0:7687" | "standalone" | "online"        | "online"      | ""    | FALSE
| "mall1"  | "0.0.0.0:7687" | "standalone" | "online"        | "online"      | ""    | FALSE
| "mall2"  | "0.0.0.0:7687" | "standalone" | "online"        | "online"      | ""    | FALSE
|===

[#graph-model]
== Graph Model

We're going to import the data into the following graph model:

image::{img}4dot0_multi_tenancy_graph_model.png[role="popup-link"]

We'll have nodes representing products, clients, tickets, and ticket items, and relationships that indicate which client purchased a ticket, the items that comprise a ticket, and the product that each item was for.

[#importing-data]
== Importing the data

We'll use the same `apoc.load.json` procedure to import the data into each of our databases.
We'll filter the JSON file by the `mall` property so that we load the data appropriately.

Let's switch to the `mall1` database and setup parameters that we'll use in our import query:

:mall: 1
:url: "file:///DelightingCustomersBDclean.json"

[source,cypher.fragment,subs="attributes"]
----
:use mall1;
include::example$importTickets.cypher[tag=params]
----

And now we'll create that indexes that we're going to need:

[source,cypher]
----
include::example$createConstraints.cypher[]
----

Now we're ready to process the JSON file.
We'll wrap our call to `apoc.load.json` inside a call to `apoc.periodic.iterate` so that our import is batched, which will avoid out of memory exceptions:

[source,cypher]
----
include::example$importTickets.cypher[tag=query]
----

:mall: 2

And now let's do the same thing for mall 2.
We'll switch to that database and setup our parameters:

[source,cypher.fragment,subs="attributes"]
----
:use mall2;
include::example$importTickets.cypher[tag=params]
----

And now we'll create that indexes that we're going to need:

[source,cypher]
----
include::example$createConstraints.cypher[]
----

And now let's import the tickets sold in this store:

[source,cypher]
----
include::example$importTickets.cypher[tag=query]
----

We can see a sample of the imported graph in the Neo4j Browser visualization below:

image::{img}4dot0_multi_tenancy_browser_viz.png[role="popup-link"]

[#querying-individual-databases]
== Querying individual databases

Now that we've imported the data, let's explore it by writing some queries.
We'll show the results of running some queries on both databases and some just on one of them.

****
[NOTE]
We can switch between the databases by running the command `:use mall1` or `:use mall2`.
****

The following query returns the biggest spending clients in the mall:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (client:Client)-[:PURCHASED]->(ticket)-[:HAS_TICKETITEM]->(item:TicketItem)
WHERE client.id <> "Unknown"
WITH client, count(DISTINCT ticket) AS tickets,
     apoc.math.round(sum(item.netAmount), 2) AS totalSpend
RETURN client.id AS clientId, totalSpend, tickets,
       apoc.math.round(totalSpend / tickets, 2) AS spendPerTicket
ORDER BY totalSpend DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

.Mall 1 biggest spenders
[opts="header"]

|===

Interestingly, the biggest spending client in both malls is the same person.

The `spendPerTicket` also looks interesting.
The following query shows the products bought by the client that has the highest `spendPerTicket` in mall 2 :

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (:Client {id: 77078849426})-[:PURCHASED]->()-->(:TicketItem)-->(:Product)
RETURN path
----

image::{img}4dot0_multi_tenancy_big_spender.png[role="popup-link",title="A big spender in Mall 2"]

On the left hand side of the diagram we can see highlighted nodes that have skewed the average spend!
My Spanish isn't great, but I can see an iPad Air among the items purchased.
_ASP ROB LG HOMB S5_ is a https://www.carrefour.es/robot-aspirador-lg-lg-hombot-turbo-vr8602rr-smart-inverter-0-6-l-60-db-rojo/8806087897081[robot vacuum cleaner^] and I think _POR APP MB MJVE2YA_ is an Apple Macbook.
The other items look more like the type of products you'd buy in a normal grocery shop.

Let's go back to mall 1 and see which products are purchased most often.
We can write the following query to compute this:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (item:TicketItem)-->(product:Product)
WITH product, apoc.math.round(sum(item.netAmount), 2) AS totalSpend,
     count(*) AS purchases
RETURN product.description, totalSpend, purchases,
       apoc.math.round(totalSpend / purchases, 2) AS costPerItem
ORDER BY totalSpend DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

.Mall 1 popular products
[opts="header"]
|===
| product.description    | totalSpend | purchases | costPerItem
| "ROSCON NATA MEDIANO"  | 4596.64    | 450       | 10.21
| "ACEITE OLIVA HOJIB"   | 3597.33    | 269       | 13.37
| "CERVEZA MAHOU CLAS"   | 3328.62    | 363       | 9.17
| "CERVEZA MAHOU 5 *"    | 2870.3     | 383       | 7.49
| "ROSCON MEDIANO SIN R" | 2632.75    | 363       | 7.25
| "ATÚN CLARO ACEITE"    | 2404.49    | 502       | 4.79
| "ROSCON DE REYES"      | 2363.89    | 158       | 14.96

| "CAMISA CRO M/LARGA"   | 2208.31    | 293       | 7.54
| "PAÑAL DODOT"          | 2186.34    | 75        | 29.15
|===

All the top items are priced at less than 30 euros each.
We can see a couple of beers (cerveza) in positions 3 and 4, and then Roscon seems to be a range of https://www.carrefour.es/supermercado/roscon-de-reyes-con-nata-1-3-kg-carrefour/R-577901507[tasty looking pastries^].

[#querying-across-databases]
== Querying across databases

We can also write queries across databases using https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/configuration/[Neo4j Fabric^].
This functionality is useful for executing aggregate queries across multiple databases.

Let's first change to the _fabric_ database by running the following command:

[source,cypher.fragment]
----
:use fabric
----

Now we're going write a query that returns the total spend on products in each of our databases.

We'll prefix our queries with the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.0/clauses/use/[`USE`^] clause, which tells the Fabric engine which database to execute the query against.
The syntax of this clause is as follows:

`USE <fabric.database.name>.<fabric.graph.*.database>`

Or in our case `USE fabric.mall1` and `USE fabric.mall2`.

The following query finds the total spend and number of purchases in each mall, combines the results using the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.0/clauses/union/#union-combine-queries-retain-duplicates[`UNION ALL`^] clause, and then orders the results by total spend:

[source,cypher]
----
USE fabric.mall1
MATCH (item:TicketItem)-->(product:Product)
RETURN "Mall 1" as mall,
       apoc.math.round(sum(item.netAmount), 2) AS totalSpend,
       count(*) AS purchases

UNION ALL

USE fabric.mall2
MATCH (item:TicketItem)-->(product:Product)
RETURN "Mall 2" as mall,
       apoc.math.round(sum(item.netAmount), 2) AS totalSpend,
       count(*) AS purchases

ORDER BY totalSpend DESC;
----

.Total spending in malls
[opts="header"]
|===
| mall     | totalSpend | purchases
| "Mall 1" | 953536.51  | 219561
| "Mall 2" | 943463.47  | 219966
|===

The total spend and number of purchases are almost identical between the malls!
We can also write a version of this query that reduces duplication by using the built-in https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/queries/#fabric-built-in-functions[`<fabric-database-name>graphIds`^] function and the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.0/clauses/call-subquery/[`CALL{}`^] clause, as shown below:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH ["Mall 1", "Mall 2"] AS malls
UNWIND fabric.graphIds() AS graphId
CALL {
  USE fabric.graph(graphId)
  MATCH (item:TicketItem)-->(product:Product)
  RETURN apoc.math.round(sum(item.netAmount), 2) AS totalSpend,
         count(*) AS purchases
}
RETURN malls[graphId] AS mall, totalSpend, purchases
ORDER BY totalSpend DESC;
----

We can also aggregate the results returned by the sub queries executed on each of the mall databases.
The following query finds the highest selling products in each mall, and then shows the top 10 products across both malls:

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND fabric.graphIds() AS graphId
CALL {
  USE fabric.graph(graphId)
  MATCH (item:TicketItem)-->(product:Product)
  WITH product, apoc.math.round(sum(item.netAmount), 2) AS totalSpend,
       count(*) AS purchases
  RETURN product, totalSpend, purchases
  ORDER BY totalSpend DESC
}
RETURN product.description, totalSpend, purchases
ORDER BY totalSpend DESC
LIMIT 10
----

| "ROSCON MEDIANO SIN R" | 2632.75    | 363
| "ACEITE OLIVA HOJIB"   | 2478.99    | 222
|===

The top selling product in both malls is _ROSCON NATA MEDIANO_, but it'd be good if the sales for each product was aggregated so that we have only one row per product.
We can do this using the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.0/functions/aggregating/#functions-sum[`SUM`^] aggregation function:

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND fabric.graphIds() AS graphId
CALL {
  USE fabric.graph(graphId)
  MATCH (item:TicketItem)-->(product:Product)
  WITH product, apoc.math.round(sum(item.netAmount), 2) AS totalSpend,
       count(*) AS purchases
  RETURN product, totalSpend, purchases
  ORDER BY totalSpend DESC
}
RETURN product.description, sum(totalSpend) AS totalSpend, sum(purchases) AS purchases
ORDER BY totalSpend DESC
LIMIT 10
----

****
[NOTE]
The implicit group by key for these aggregation functions is `product.description` and *not* `product`.
The product node is completely different in each of the databases, so if we grouped by that we'd still end up with individual per product sold in each mall.
****

The table below shows the results of running the aggregation query:
