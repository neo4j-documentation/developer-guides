== Neo4j for R Developers and Data Scientists

=== Neo4R

The goal of \{neo4r\} is to provide a modern and flexible Neo4J driver for R.

It’s modern in the sense that the results are returned as tibbles whenever possible, it relies on modern tools, and it is designed to work with pipes.
Our goal is to provide a driver that can be easily integrated in a data analysis workflow, especially by providing an API working smoothly with other data analysis (`\{dplyr\}` or `\{purrr\}`) and graph packages (`\{igraph}`, `\{ggraph\}`, `\{visNetwork\}`…).

It was developed by https://thinkr.fr/[ThinkR], led by Colin Fay.

Currently it connects to Neo4j via Http but we plan to integrate it with the C-connector for Bolt, Seabolt.

=== neo4jshell

The goal of neo4jshell is to provide rapid querying of Neo4j graph databases by offering a programmatic interface with 'cypher-shell'.

It is developed by Keith McNulty.

=== RNeo4j

RNeo4j was written by our own data scientists https://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret[Nicole White^], to combine the analytics abilities of R with the interconnected data in Neo4j.
The RNeo4j package not only offers convenient access to Neo4j but also idiomatic integration with R the language and the R-Studio environment.

Nicole also detailed the usage in a number of blog posts and applications.
