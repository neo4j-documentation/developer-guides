:description: In this page, we will learn how to build and deploy a GRANDstack application with Neo4j Aura.

.Goals
[abstract]
{description}

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
We should have created and started a Neo4j Aura database instance.
If we have not already, we can follow the instructions in the link:https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037562253-Working-with-Neo4j-Aura[getting started guide] to step through the process.
We should also be familiar with the https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^].

[role=expertise {level}]
{level}

Now that we've created our Neo4j Aura database, we're going to learn how to deploy a GRANDstack application that queries data stored in that database.

[#our-dataset]
== The Football Transfers Graph

We're going to deploy an application built on top of a graph containing football transfers scraped from https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/[transfermarkt.co.uk].
See https://medium.com/neo4j/football-transfers-graph-e8ba7347169e[Football Transfers Graph^] to learn more about the dataset.

== Connect to Neo4j Aura with Neo4j Desktop

The first thing we need to do, in link:/developer/neo4j-desktop/[Neo4j Desktop^], is create a remote connection to our Aura database.
See the link:/developer/aura-connect-neo4j-desktop/[Connect to Neo4j Aura with Neo4j Desktop^] guide for step by step instructions explaining how to do this.

[#neo4j-cloud-tool]
== Neo4j Cloud Tool

We're going to use the Neo4j Cloud Tool to import our data, so let's see how to set up that application.
We can install that link:neo4j://graphapps/install?url=https://neo.jfrog.io/neo/api/npm/npm/neo4j-cloud-ui[directly via this link], or if that doesn't work we can paste the following URL into the `Graph App URL` field on the Graph Applications menu:

[source, text]
----
https://neo.jfrog.io/neo/api/npm/npm/neo4j-cloud-ui
----

image::{img}/grandstack-install-graphapp-manual.png[role="popup-link"]

Once we do that we'll see the following prompt:

image::{img}/grandstack-install-graphapp.png[role="popup-link"]

We can now launch the Neo4j Cloud Tool, which will take us to the following screen:

image::{img}/grandstack-neo4j-cloud-tool-launched.png[role="popup-link"]


[#importing-database]
== Importing the dataset

We're going to use the Neo4j Cloud tool to import this dataset.

Click on the `Check existing database` button.
This will check whether our Aura database contains existing data.
Assuming an empty database, we'll see the following screen:

image::{img}/grandstack-neo4j-cloud-tool-check-existing.png[role="popup-link"]

Clicking on the `Next` button will take us to the following screen:

image::{img}/grandstack-neo4j-cloud-tool-select-database-dump.png[role="popup-link"]

From here we can import databases or a dump file.
We'll be using the latter functionality to import a dump containing the football transfers database.

The dump file can be downloaded from https://aura-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/football-transfers.dump[aura-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/football-transfers.dump].
Once we've downloaded that file we'll select it as the dump file to import.
After that we'll click on the `Import Dump file` button.
This will take a few minutes to run, but eventually we'll see output similar to the following:

image::{img}/grandstack-neo4j-cloud-tool-done.png[role="popup-link"]

Click on the `View data in Neo4j Browser` button to see what we've imported.
The diagram below shows a sample of the imported graph:

image::{img}/grandstack-neo4j-browser.png[role="popup-link"]

[#our-application]
== Our Application

Let's have a look at the GRANDstack application that we're going to deploy.
The application is a football transfers one built on top of the graph that we imported in the previous step.
See https://blog.grandstack.io/football-transfers-graph-app-with-the-grandstack-starter-kit-b8dfa62c322e[Football Transfers Graph App with the GRANDstack Starter Kit^] to learn more about the application itself.

The following command will clone the football transfers project locally:

[source,bash]
----
git@github.com:mneedham/football-transfers-app.git
cd football-transfers-app
----

The application has two parts:

* API - this code powers a GraphQL API on top of our Neo4j database, and lives in the `api` directory.
* UI - the `ui` directory contains a React application that renders data extracted from the GraphQL API.

The diagram below shows the architecture of our application and how it interacts with Neo4j:

image::{img}/grandstack-architecture.png[role="popup-link"]

== Now CLI

We're going to deploy the application using ZEIT, a cloud platform for websites and serverless APIS.

First we'll need to create an account on that platform via https://zeit.co/signup[zeit.co/signup^].

image::{img}/zeit_signup.png[role="popup-link"]

Once we've done that we can install the Now CLI on our machine using instructions from https://zeit.co/download[zeit.co/download^]:

[source,bash]
----
npm i -g now
----

Now let's login to ZEIT using the Now CLI tool:

[source,bash]
----
now login
----

If we run that, we'll see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
> Enter your email: xxx@xxx.com
> We sent an email to xxx. Please follow the steps provided
  inside it and make sure the security code matches xxx.
----

Once we've entered our credentials we'll receive an email which will contain a link that we need to click to verify that we want to login.
The console will then be updated with the following message:

[source,bash]
----
âœ” Email confirmed
> Congratulations! You are now logged in. In order to deploy something, run `now`.
----

== Define credentials

Now we're ready to tell ZEIT about our database credentials.
We'll need to provide the following details:

* Bolt URL
* Username
* Password

If we open our https://console.neo4j.io/#databases[Neo4j Aura Console Dashboard^], we'll see a list of our databases.

image::{img}/grandstack-database.png[role="popup-link"]

We'll need to use the Bolt URL, so let's copy that onto our clipboard:

image::{img}/grandstack-database-highlight-bolt.png[role="popup-link"]

The default username is `neo4j` and the default password is generated on database creation.

image::{img}/grandstack-database-password.png[role="popup-link"]

For the database described above we'd have the following credentials:

* Bolt URL - `bolt+routing://648d934e.databases.neo4j.io`
* Username - `neo4j`
* Password - `9UvUS6UnVAnr7_ziNaKg--e7ekd-5x4AEL7yseEFsl8`

We can run the following commands to add these credentials as ZEIT secrets.

[NOTE]
====
Don't forget to change the credentials below to match those of your own Aura database.
Copy and pasting the credentials below won't work as that database has long since been destroyed!
====

[source,bash]
----
now secret add NEO4J_URI bolt+routing://648d934e.databases.neo4j.io
now secret add NEO4J_USER neo4j
now secret add NEO4J_PASSWORD 9UvUS6UnVAnr7_ziNaKg--e7ekd-5x4AEL7yseEFsl8
----

== Deploying GRANDstack application

We're now ready to deploy our application, which we can do by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
now
----

Running this command will result in the following output:

[source,bash]
----
> Deploying ~/projects/football-transfers-app under mneedham
> Using project grand-stack-starter
> Synced 21 files [652ms]
> Upload [====================] 99% 0.0s> NOTE: This is the first deployment in the grand-stack-starter project. It will be promoted to production.
> NOTE: To deploy to production in the future, run `now --prod`.
> https://grand-stack-starter-ou2l4008p.now.sh [4s]
> Ready! Deployment complete [2m]
- https://grand-stack-starter-seven-wheat.now.sh
- https://grand-stack-starter.mneedham.now.sh [in clipboard]
----

We can then navigate to the provided URL, which in this case is `https://grand-stack-starter-seven-wheat.now.sh/`.
Once this page has loaded, we'll see a list of the top transfers:

image::{img}/grandstack-deployed-transfers.png[role="popup-link"]

We can navigate to other screens via the left menu:

image::{img}/grandstack-deployed-menu.png[role="popup-link"]

My favourite one is `Country Money Flow`, so let's have a look at that:

image::{img}/grandstack-deployed-country-money-flow.png[role="popup-link"]

We've now deployed our first GRANDstack application.

[#aura-help]
== Help and Questions

Helpful guides and support are available on the link:https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us[Aura support^] pages.

You can also ask questions and connect with other people launching Neo4j Aura at the
https://community.neo4j.com/c/neo4j-graph-platform/cloud[cloud topic^] on the community site.

// The most interesting part of the API is our GraphQL schema, which lives in https://github.com/mneedham/football-transfers-app/blob/master/api/src/schema.graphql[`api/src/schema.graphql`^].
// Below is a small part of the schema:
//
// [source,graphql]
// ----
// type Club {
//    _id: Long!
//    id: String!
//    image: String
//    name: String!
//    in_league: League @relation(name: "IN_LEAGUE", direction: "OUT")
//    transfers_from_club: [Transfer] @relation(name: "FROM_CLUB", direction: "IN")
//    transfers_to_club: [Transfer] @relation(name: "TO_CLUB", direction: "IN")
// }
// ----
//
// This fragment defines a `Club` type that will return nodes that have the `Club` label.
// It maps some basic properties: `id`, `image`, and `name`, and also allows us to navigate to some other types, including:
//
//
// * the `League` that a club plays in using the `in_league` property.
// This property traverses the `IN_LEAGUE` relationship type going `OUT` from the club.
// * the `Transfers` going from a club using the `transfers_from_club` property
// This property traverses the `FROM_CLUB` relationship type coming `IN` to the club.
// * the `Transfers` going to a club using the `transfers_to_club` property
// This property traverses the `TO_CLUB` relationship type coming `IN` to the club
//
// === UI
//
// The `ui` directory contains a React application that renders data extracted from the GraphQL API.
//
// Let's take a look at https://github.com/mneedham/football-transfers-app/blob/master/ui/src/TopTransfers.js#L54[ui/src/TopTransfers.js^], which contains a component that renders the most expensive transfers:
// In the middle of the file we find the following code:
//
// [source,js]
// ----
// const QUERY = gql`
//   query topTransfers(
//     $orderBy: [_TransferOrdering]
//     $first: Int
//     $offset: Int
//     $filter: _TransferFilter
//   ) {
//     Transfer(
//       first: $first
//       orderBy: $orderBy
//       offset: $offset
//       filter: $filter
//     ) {
//       date { formatted }
//       value
//       id
//       of_player { name image }
//       from_club { name image }
//       to_club { name image
//       }
//     }
//   }
// `;
// ----
//
// This fragment defines a GraphQL query that returns various properties related to `Transfers`.
// We call that query in the `Query` component further down the file:
//
// [source,js]
// ----
// <Query
//   query={QUERY}
//   variables={{
//     first: this.state.rowsPerPage,
//     offset: this.state.rowsPerPage * this.state.page,
//     filter: { AND: [this.getFromClubFilter(), this.getToClubFilter()] },
//     orderBy: this.state.orderBy + "_" + this.state.order
//   }}
// >
// ----
//
// This component executes the GraphQL query and returns a collection of results in the `data` variable.
// We then iterate over that collection, rendering one row per transfer.
