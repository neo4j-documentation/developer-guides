[#airports-dataset]
== Airports dataset

In this guide we're going to use an airports dataset that contains connections between US airports in January 2008.
We have the data in a CSV file, and this is the graph model that we're going to import it into:

image::{img}/initial_model.png[role="popup-link"]

Before we import any data, we're going to create a unique constraint on the `Airport` label and `code` property to ensure that we don't accidentally import duplicate airports.
The following query creates this constraint:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (airport:Airport)
ASSERT airport.code IS UNIQUE
----

.Results
|===
| 0 rows available after 86 ms, consumed after another 0 ms. Added 1 constraints
|===

And the following query loads the data from a CSV file using the `LOAD CSV` tool:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/training/master/modeling/data/flights_1k.csv" AS row
MERGE (origin:Airport {code: row.Origin})
MERGE (destination:Airport {code: row.Dest})
MERGE (origin)-[connection:CONNECTED_TO {
  airline: row.UniqueCarrier,
  flightNumber: row.FlightNum,
  date: date({year: toInteger(row.Year), month: toInteger(row.Month), day: toInteger(row.DayofMonth)}),
  cancelled: row.Cancelled,
  diverted: row.Diverted}]->(destination)
ON CREATE SET connection.departure = localtime(apoc.text.lpad(row.CRSDepTime, 4, "0")),
              connection.arrival = localtime(apoc.text.lpad(row.CRSArrTime, 4, "0"))
----

This query:

* Creates a node with an `Airport` label with a `code` property that has a value from the `Origin` column in the CSV file
* Creates a node with an `Airport` label with a `code` property that has a value from the `Dest` column in the CSV file
* Creates a relationship of type `CONNECTED_TO` with several properties based on columns in the CSV file.

If we run this query we'll see the following output:

.Results
|===
| Added 62 labels, created 62 nodes, set 7062 properties, created 1000 relationships, completed after 376 ms.
|===

This model is a good starter one, but there are some improvements that we can make.

[#property-to-boolean]
== Convert property to boolean

The `diverted` and `cancelled` properties on the `CONNECTED_TO` relationships contain string values of `1` and `0`.
Since these values are representing booleans, we can use the https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/graph-updates/graph-refactoring/normalize-boolean/[`apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean`^] procedure to convert the values from strings to booleans.

image::{img}/boolean_refactoring.png[role="popup-link"]

The following query does the conversion for the `diverted` property:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Airport)-[connectedTo:CONNECTED_TO]->(:Airport)
CALL apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean(connectedTo, "diverted", ["1"], ["0"])
RETURN count(*)
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| count(*)
| 1000
|===

And the following query does the conversion for the `cancelled` property:


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (origin:Airport)-[connectedTo:CONNECTED_TO]->(departure)
CALL apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean(connectedTo, "cancelled", ["1"], ["0"])
RETURN count(*)
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| count(*)
| 1000
|===

If we have a lot of relationships to update, we may get an OutOfMemory exception if we try to refactor them all in one transaction.
We can therefore process them in batches using the https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/graph-updates/periodic-execution/#commit-batching[`apoc.periodic.iterate`^] procedure.
The following query does this for the `cancelled` and `reverted` properties in the same query:

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND ["cancelled", "reverted"] AS propertyToDelete
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (:Airport)-[connectedTo:CONNECTED_TO]->(:Airport) RETURN connectedTo",
  "CALL apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean(connectedTo, $propertyToDelete, ['1'], ['0'])
   RETURN count(*)",
  {params: {propertyToDelete: propertyToDelete}, batchSize: 100})
YIELD batches
RETURN propertyToDelete, batches
----

The `apoc.periodic.iterate` procedure in this query takes in 3 parameters:

* An outer Cypher query that finds and returns a stream of `CONNECTED_TO` relationships to be processed.
* An inner Cypher query that processes those `CONNECTED_TO` relationships, converting to boolean any values for the specified property on those relationships. It does this using the `apoc.refactor.normalizeAsBoolean` procedure, which itself takes in several parameters:
  ** the entity on which the property exists
  ** the name of the property to normalize
  ** a list of values that should be considered `true`
  ** a list of values that should be considered `false`
* Configuration values for the procedure, including:
  ** `params` - parameters passed into those Cypher queries
  ** `batchSize`- controls the number of inner statements that are run within a single transaction

When we run this query we'll see the following output:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertyToDelete | batches
| "cancelled"      | 10
| "reverted"       | 10
|===

Once we've done this, we can write the following query to return all cancelled connections:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (origin:Airport)-[connectedTo:CONNECTED_TO]->(destination)
WHERE connectedTo.cancelled
RETURN origin.code AS origin,
       destination.code AS destination,
       connectedTo.date AS date,
       connectedTo.departure AS departure,
       connectedTo.arrival AS arrival
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| origin | destination | date | departure | arrival
| "LAS"  | "OAK"       | 2008-01-03 | 07:00     | 08:30
| "LAX"  | "SFO"       | 2008-01-03 | 09:05     | 10:25
| "LAX"  | "OAK"       | 2008-01-03 | 11:00     | 12:15
| "LAX"  | "SJC"       | 2008-01-03 | 19:30     | 20:35
| "LAX"  | "SFO"       | 2008-01-03 | 16:20     | 17:40
| "MDW"  | "STL"       | 2008-01-03 | 11:10     | 12:15
| "MDW"  | "BDL"       | 2008-01-03 | 08:45     | 11:40
| "MDW"  | "DTW"       | 2008-01-03 | 06:00     | 08:05
| "MDW"  | "STL"       | 2008-01-03 | 14:45     | 15:50
| "MDW"  | "BNA"       | 2008-01-03 | 19:25     | 20:45
| "OAK"  | "BUR"       | 2008-01-03 | 13:10     | 14:15
| "OAK"  | "BUR"       | 2008-01-03 | 17:05     | 18:10

[#create-node-from-relationship]
== Create node from relationship

Next, imagine that we want to write a query that finds a specific flight.
This is quite difficult with our existing model because flights are represented as relationships.
We can evolve our model to create a `Flight` node from the properties stored on the `CONNECTED_TO` relationship.

image::{img}/flight_node.png[role="popup-link"]

The following query does this refactoring:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (origin:Airport)-[connected:CONNECTED_TO]->(destination:Airport) RETURN origin, connected, destination",
  "CREATE (flight:Flight {
     date: connected.date,
     airline: connected.airline,
     number: connected.flightNumber,
     departure: connected.departure,
     arrival: connected.arrival,
     cancelled: connected.cancelled,
     diverted: connected.diverted
   })
   MERGE (origin)<-[:ORIGIN]-(flight)
   MERGE (flight)-[:DESTINATION]->(destination)
   DELETE connected",
  {batchSize: 100})
----

As with our previous query, this query uses the `apoc.periodic.iterate` procedure so that we can do the refactoring in batches rather than within a single transaction.
The procedure takes in 3 parameters:

* An outer Cypher query that finds and returns a stream of `CONNECTED_TO` relationships, and origin and destination airports that need to be processed.
* An inner Cypher query that processes those entities, creating a node with the label `Flight` and creating relationships from that node to the origin and destination airports.
*  `batchSize` configuration, which sets to `100` the number of inner statements that are run within a single transaction.

If we execute the query we'll see the following output:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| batches | total | timeTaken | committedOperations | failedOperations | failedBatches | retries | errorMessages | batch                                           | operations                                      | wasTerminated
| 10      | 1000  | 0         | 1000                | 0                | 0             | 0       | {}            | {total: 10, committed: 10, failed: 0, errors: {}} | {total: 1000, committed: 1000, failed: 0, errors: {}} | FALSE
|===


We can also do this refactoring using the https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/graph-updates/graph-refactoring/extract-node-from-relationship/[`apoc.refactor.extractNode`^] procedure.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (origin:Airport)-[connected:CONNECTED_TO]->(destination:Airport)
   RETURN origin, connected, destination",
  "CALL apoc.refactor.extractNode([connected], ['Flight'], 'DESTINATION', 'ORIGIN')
   YIELD input, output, error
   RETURN input, output, error",
  {batchSize: 100});
----

This does the same as the previous query, but the outer Cypher query uses the `apoc.refactor.extractNode` procedure to create the `Flight` node and create relationships to origin and destination airports.
If we run this query we'll see the following output:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| batches | total | timeTaken | committedOperations | failedOperations | failedBatches | retries | errorMessages | batch                                           | operations                                      | wasTerminated
| 10      | 1000  | 0         | 1000                | 0                | 0             | 0       | {}            | {total: 10, committed: 10, failed: 0, errors: {}} | {total: 1000, committed: 1000, failed: 0, errors: {}} | FALSE
|===


[#create-node-from-property]
== Create node from property

At the moment the airline for our flights is stored in the `airline` property on `Flight` nodes.
This means that if we wanted to return a stream of all airlines we'd need to scan through every flight and check the `airline` property on each of those flights.

We can make it easier, and more efficient, to write this query by creating a node with an `Airline` label for each airline:

image::{img}/airline.png[role="popup-link"]

Let's first create a constraint on the `Airline` label and `name` property so that we don't create duplicate airline nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (airline:Airline)
ASSERT airline.name IS UNIQUE
----

.Results
|===
| 0 rows available after 107 ms, consumed after another 0 ms. Added 1 constraints
|===

And now we can execute the following query to do the refactoring:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
   'MATCH (flight:Flight) RETURN flight',
   'MERGE (airline:Airline {name:flight.airline})
    MERGE (flight)-[:AIRLINE]->(airline)
    REMOVE flight.airline',
   {batchSize:10000, iterateList:true, parallel:false}
)
----

Again we're using the `apoc.periodic.iterate` procedure, with the following parameters:

* An outer Cypher statement that returns a stream of `Flight` nodes to be processed
* An inner Cypher statementthat processes these flight nodes, creating `Airline` nodes based on flights' `airline` property and created an `AIRLINE` relationship from the `Flight` to the `Airline` node. We then remove the `airline` property from the `Flight` node.

If we run this query we'll see the following output:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| batches | total | timeTaken | committedOperations | failedOperations | failedBatches | retries | errorMessages | batch                                           | operations                                      | wasTerminated
| 1       | 1000  | 0         | 1000                | 0                | 0             | 0       | {}            | {total: 1, committed: 1, failed: 0, errors: {}} | {total: 1000, committed: 1000, failed: 0, errors: {}} | FALSE
|===

We can then write the following query to find the airlines and number of flights involving each:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (airline:Airline)<-[:AIRLINE]-(:Flight)
RETURN airline.name AS airline, count(*) AS numberOfFlights
----

This does the same as the previous query, but the outer Cypher query uses the `apoc.refactor.extractNode` procedure to create the `Flight` node and create relationships to origin and destination airports.
If we run this query we'll see the following output:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| airline | numberOfFlights
| "WN" | 1000
|===
