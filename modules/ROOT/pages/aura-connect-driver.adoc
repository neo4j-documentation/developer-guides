.Prerequisites
[abstract]
We should have created and started a Neo4j Aura database instance.
If we have not already, we can follow the instructions in the link:https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037562253-Working-with-Neo4j-Aura[getting started guide^] to step through the process.

[#aura-db-credentials]
== Get database credentials

When using any of the language drivers, before we try to connect to our Neo4j Aura Database, we'll need three pieces of information:

* Bolt URL
* Username
* Password

If we open our https://console.neo4j.io/#databases[Neo4j Aura Console Dashboard^], we'll see a list of our databases.

We'll need to use the Bolt URL, so let's copy that onto our clipboard:

image::{img}/dbaas_database_created_highlight_browser.png[role="popup-link"]

The default username is `neo4j` and the default password is generated on database creation.

For the database described above we'd have the following credentials:

* Bolt URL - `bolt+routing://178c6768.databases.neo4j.io`
* Username - `neo4j`
* Password - `our-super-secret-password`

== Connect with driver

Now that we've got our credentials, we're ready to connect using a driver.

The link:/developer/language-guides/[Drivers and Languages Guides^] page gives an overview of Neo4j drivers and explains the Bolt protocol used to interact with the database.
There are also guides for individual language drivers, including officially supported ones for the following languages:

* link:/developer/dotnet/[.NET]
* link:/developer/java/[Java]
* link:/developer/javascript/[JavaScript]
* link:/developer/go/[Go]
* link:/developer/python/[Python]
