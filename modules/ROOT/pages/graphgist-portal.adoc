[#about-graphgists]
{graphgists_list}[Neo4j Graph Gists] are an easy way to create and share your documents containing not just prose, structure and pictures but most importantly **example graph models and use cases** expressed in Neo4j's query language, link:/developer/cypher[Cypher].
They are very helpful to share knowledge among the Neo4j community and help developers and others within your own organization by showing real-life solutions.

These documents are written in a simple, textual markup language (http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc^]) and are rendered in your browser as rich and interactive web pages that you can quickly evolve by describing simple how-tos or questions to providing an extensive use case specification.

To see the expressive power of this approach, here are some winners of our past community competitions:

[#graphgist-info]
== Getting Started

More information on getting started building your own GraphGist is available on the {graphgist_portal}[GraphGist Portal^].
You can also explore the full range of GraphGists from xref:neo4j-desktop.adoc[Neo4j Desktop] using the *Graph Gallery* Graph App.
You can install the Graph App with a single click at https://install.graphapp.io[install.graphapp.io^]
