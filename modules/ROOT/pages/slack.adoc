The Neo4j Slack group has been retired. Please join us on https://discord.gg/neo4j[Neo4j Discord].

Slack is awesome and has been an incredible way to connect with everyone in the community. 
As we've grown, connected across different communities, and engaged in more online events,
Discord has emerged as a better way to keep the conversation going.
