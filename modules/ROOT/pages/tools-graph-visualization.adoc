[#graph-vis-types]
== Types of Graph Visualization

There are 3 architectural categories into which most of our graph visualization tools fall.
We will discuss how each of these categories handles the exported data and provide some pros and cons of the different architectures.
Depending on the visualization needs, one of these categories may define the set of tools you can choose to implement as a solution to your business needs.

[#embed-graph-vis]
=== 1. Embeddable tools with built-in Neo4j connections

These kinds of tools can be included as a dependency within an application and can easily be configured and styled for your application and Neo4j.
Each is easily connected to an instance of the graph database using configuration properties and allows you to style the visualization based on nodes, relationships, or specific properties.

Embedding the visualization within the application allows the developer to create applications that include the visualization as part of the user interface.
This also means that the developer can write other components and customize the application experience and other components involved in the application to the exact business requirements.

On the downside, these libraries don’t often support extremely complex or heavy workloads and do not have vendor support or SLAs for functionality requests.
Because they are managed by the community, the tools depend on the community for support and feature improvements.
Also, this typically means that our client application is connecting directly to the database, which might not always be the desired architecture.

Let us look at some of the tools in this category.

==== icon:flask[] *Neovis.js*
This library was designed to combine JavaScript visualization and Neo4j in a seamless integration.
Connection to Neo4j is simple and straightforward, and because it is built with Neo4j’s property graph model in mind, the data format Neovis expects aligns with the database.
Customizing and coloring styles based on labels, properties, nodes, and relationships is defined in a single configuration object.
Neovis.js can be used without writing Cypher and with minimal JavaScript for integrating into your project.

====
[TIP]
icon:flask[size=2x] The Neovis library is one of our Neo4j Labs projects.

====

To maximize functionality and data analysis capabilities through visualization, you can also combine this library with the graph algorithms library in Neo4j to style the visualization to align with results of algorithms such as page rank, centrality, communities, and more.
Below, we see a graph visualization of Game Of Thrones character interactions rendered by neovis.js, and enhanced using Neo4j graph algorithms by applying link:/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/page-rank/[pagerank^] and link:/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/community/[community detection^] algorithms to the styling of the visualization.

image:{img}/example-viz.png[role="popup-link"]

An advantage of enhancing graph visualization with these algorithms is that we can visually interpret the results of these algorithms.

* Download neovis.js: https://www.npmjs.com/package/neovis.js[npm package^]

==== Popoto.js
Popoto.js is a JavaScript library that is built upon D3.js.
Popoto.js will help users build queries in a visual way to execute against Neo4j.
Users can also customize the results and the visual display.
Along with the visualization, you can include auto-complete searches for potential queries, see the Cypher translations that are generated from the visualization, review text results from queries, and more.

To use Popoto.js in your application, you simply need to include each component independently bound to a container id in an HTML page.
The rest of the content will be generated from that.

[#embed-lib-vis]
=== 2. Embeddable libraries without direct Neo4j connection

These libraries offer the ability to embed graph visualization in an application, but without connecting directly to Neo4j.
An advantage here is that we can populate our visualization with data sent from an API application that connects to the database, ensuring the client application is not querying the database directly.
The downside, however, is that we often must transform the results to export from Neo4j into the format expected by these libraries.

We can get a closer look at these tools in the next paragraphs.

==== D3.js
As the first line on D3’s website states "D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data."
You can bind different kinds of data to a DOM and then execute different kinds of functions on it.
One of those functions includes generating an SVG, canvas, or HTML visualization from the data in the DOM.

image::{img}/d3_visualization.jpg[role="popup-link",float="right",width=350]

Neo4j’s movie example applications use d3.js, and you can find a variety of other projects using Neo4j and d3.
The complicated part of D3 (or any embeddable library that doesn’t have direct Neo4j connection) is converting your graph data into the expected map format for export.
D3 expects two different collections of graph data - one for nodes[] and one for links[] (relationships).
Each of these maps includes arrays of properties for each node and relationship that d3 then converts into circles and lines.
Version 4 and 5 of d3.js also support force-directed graphs, where the visualization adjusts to the user’s view pane.

* Neo4j Github examples with d3: https://github.com/neo4j-examples?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=movie&type=&language=[Examples with Neo4j^]

==== *Vis.js*
This library offers a variety of visualizations designed to handle large, dynamic data sets.
There are a variety of formats to style your data, including timeline, dataset, graph2d, graph3d, and network.
The most common format seen with Neo4j is the network visualization.

Even with the network format, there are numerous customizations available for styling nodes, labels, animations, coloring, grouping, and others.
For additional information and to see everything that is available, check out their docs and examples linked in the resources below.

* Source code project: https://github.com/almende/vis[Vis.js Github^]

==== Sigma.js
While some libraries are meant to include all the capabilities in one bundle, Sigma.js touts a highly-extensible environment where users can add extension libraries or plugins to provide additional capability.
This library takes exported data in either https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/master/plugins/sigma.parsers.json[JSON^] or https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/master/plugins/sigma.parsers.gexf[GEXF^] formats.

image::{img}/sigmajs_visualization.jpg[role="popup-link",float="right",width=350]

Users can start from a very basic visualization right out of the box, and then begin adding custom functions and rendering for styling preferences.
Once the requirements surpass what is possible there, users can write and use their own custom plugins for specific functionality.
Be sure to check out the repository, though, for any existing extensions!

==== Vivagraph.js
Vivagraph.js was built to handle different types of layout algorithms for arranging nodes and edges.
It manages data set sizes from very small to very large and also renders in WebGL, SVG, and CSS-based formats.
Customizations and styling are available through CSS modifications and extension libraries.
It also can track changes in the graph that update the visualization accordingly.

==== Cytoscape.js
This library is also meant to visualize and render network node graphs and offers customization and extensibility for additional features.
Cytoscape.js responds to user interaction and works on touch screen interfaces, allowing users to zoom, tap, and explore in the method that is relevant to them.
You can customize styling and web page view with a variety of style components.

[#neo4j-vis-vendors]
=== 3. Standalone product tools

Certain tools and products are designed as standalone applications that can connect to Neo4j and interact with the stored data without involving any code.
These applications are built with non-developers in mind - for business analysts, data scientists, managers, and other users to interact with Neo4j in a node-graph format.

Many of these tools involve commercial licenses and support but can be configured specifically to your use case and custom requirements.
They also require little or no developer integration hours and setup.

The next paragraphs will help us get a feel for the types of products in this area.
