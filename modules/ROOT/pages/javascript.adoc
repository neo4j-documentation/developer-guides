== Neo4j for JavaScript Developers

Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its binary and HTTP APIs.

You can use the official driver for JavaScript (neo4j-driver) or connect via HTTP using the `request` module or any of our community drivers.

As a demonstration of a minimal JavaScript based bolt driver, Nigel Small put together https://js2neo.org/[js2neo^].

[#js-http-endpoint]
== Using the HTTP-Endpoint directly

You can use something as simple as the `request` node-module to send queries to and receive responses from Neo4j.
The endpoint protocol and formats are explained in detail in the link:/docs/http-api/current/introduction/[Neo4j Manual^].
It enables you do to much more, e.g. sending many statements per request or keeping transactions open across multiple requests.

Here is a very simple example:

.Simple Function Accessing the Remote Endpoint
[source, javascript]
----
var r=require("request");
var txUrl = "http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit";
function cypher(query,params,cb) {
  r.post({uri:txUrl,
          json:{statements:[{statement:query,parameters:params}]}},
         function(err,res) { cb(err,res.body)})
}
----

.Running the Function
[source, javascript]
----
var query="MATCH (n:User) RETURN n, labels(n) as l LIMIT {limit}"
var params={limit: 10}
var cb=function(err,data) { console.log(JSON.stringify(data)) }

cypher(query,params,cb)

{"results":[
  {"columns":["n","l"],
   "data":[
     {"row":[{"name":"Aran"},["User"]]}
    ]
  }],
 "errors":[]}
----
