[#neo4j-javascript]
== Neo4j for JavaScript Developers

Neo4j provides drivers which allow you to make a connection to the database and develop applications
which create, read, update, and delete information from the graph.

You can use the official driver for JavaScript (neo4j-driver) or connect via HTTP using the `request` module or any of our community drivers.

In this free course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your Node.js projects.
You will learn about the Neo4j JavaScript Driver, how sessions and transactions work and how to query Neo4j from an existing application.

=== link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-typescript/?ref=guides[Building Neo4j Applications with TypeScript^]

[Building Neo4j Applications with TypeScript^] course is a shorter course, with an estimated duration of two hours, aimed at TypeScript developers that are interested in learning the TypeScript specific features which add type-checking to any interactions you have with a Neo4j instance.

[#js-http-endpoint]
== Using the HTTP-Endpoint directly

You can use something as simple as the `request` node-module to send queries to and receive responses from Neo4j.
The endpoint protocol and formats are explained in detail in the link:/docs/http-api/current/introduction/[Neo4j Manual^].
It enables you do to much more, e.g. sending many statements per request or keeping transactions open across multiple requests.

Here is a very simple example:

.Simple Function Accessing the Remote Endpoint
[source, javascript]
----
var r=require("request");
var txUrl = "http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/tx/commit"; // neo4j is the database name
function cypher(query,params,cb) {
  r.post({uri:txUrl,
          json:{statements:[{statement:query,parameters:params}]}},
         function(err,res) { cb(err,res.body)})
}
----

.Running the Function
[source, javascript]
----
var query="MATCH (n:User) RETURN n, labels(n) as l LIMIT {limit}"
var params={limit: 10}
var cb=function(err,data) { console.log(JSON.stringify(data)) }

cypher(query,params,cb)

{"results":[
  {"columns":["n","l"],
   "data":[
     {"row":[{"name":"Aran"},["User"]]}
    ]
  }],
 "errors":[]}
----
