Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities for developers using Java or other JVM-languages.

The standalone Neo4j Server can be installed on any machine and then accessed via its *binary "Bolt" protocol* through our official driver or any bolt-enabled drivers.

You can also extend Neo4j by implementing *user defined procedures for Cypher* in Java or other JVM languages.
