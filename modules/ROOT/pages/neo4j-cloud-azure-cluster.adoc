:description: This guide explains how to deploy a Neo4j Enterprise Causal Cluster via Microsoft Azure.

.Goals
[abstract]
{description}

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
. You have a Neo4j Enterprise license or a link:/lp/enterprise-cloud/?utm_content=azure-marketplace[trial license for Azure^].
. You should have familiarity with {opsmanual}/clustering/causal-clustering/introduction/[causal cluster architecture^].
. Knowledge of link:/developer/language-guides/[remote drivers] to access Neo4j from your application helps you connect to your cloud-hosted database.

Let's get started!

[#neo4j-azure]
== Select Neo4j from the Azure Marketplace

Navigate to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/[Azure Marketplace^] and
search for Neo4j, selecting the Neo4j Enterprise Causal Cluster.
https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neo4j.neo4j-enterprise-causal-cluster?tab=Overview[This link^] will also take you directly to the right marketplace entry.

Click "Get it Now".
A dialog will pop up providing basic details of the solution.
Click "Continue".

[#config-cluster]
== Configuring Your Cluster

The next screen provides a description of the solution and some screenshots.
At the very bottom, the "Resource Manager" deployment approach will be pre-selected.
Click "Create".

The first step is to configure some basics, shown below.

The admin account name will be used for SSH access to the machines in your cluster.
We recommend creating a new resource group to hold the artifacts of your deployment.
Once complete, click "OK".

In the next section, you need to choose a password for the Neo4j user.
You also select the number of core and read replica nodes in your cluster, along with the VM size, disk size/type, and IP allocation method.

The cluster size (core and read replica nodes, along with VM size) is the largest cost driver of the cluster.
You will be billed for Azure resource time only.
As this is a "bring your own license" offering, you will not be billed hourly for the Neo4j software.

Make sure to choose a meaningful name for the Neo4j Cluster Name.
Most resources in the deployment will be named following this pattern.
Click "OK" to continue.

On the summary page, you will see a recap of all of your choices.
At this stage, Azure runs a validation process.
The most common reason that validation might fail is if you choose VMs that are too large and exceed your Azure quota.
These errors can be resolved by choosing smaller VMs or by increasing your VM quota.

On the final screen, you will be prompted to accept terms and conditions.
At the bottom of the page, click "Create".

Your cluster deployment has now begun and may take about 10 minutes to complete.
You can monitor your deployment by checking the resource group you created and the "Deployments" menu underneath that.

[#use-browser]
== Start using Neo4j Browser

After the deployment succeeds, we are now ready to start using Neo4j!

Locate the IP address of any of the core VMs created as part of the deployment.
Use your browser to access that IP or hostname as follows:

[source,shell]
----
https://[MY-AZURE-IP]:7473/
----

You may log in with user `neo4j` and the Neo4j password you chose in the configuration step.
You may see an SSL warning screen because the out-of-the-box deployment uses an unsigned SSL certificate.

To verify that the cluster has formed correctly, run the cypher statement `CALL dbms.cluster.overview()`.

[#ssh-instance]
== How do I SSH into the instance?

You may SSH into any of the machines using the admin credentials chosen in the first step of the deployment, along with the IP or hostname chosen as part of the deployment process.

[#vm-workings]
== How the Virtual Machines Work

Please consult {opsmanual}/cloud-deployments/cloudVms/[Neo4j Cloud VMs^] for details on internals of virtual machines, including configure Neo4j inside of the VM and access various files.

[#default-config]
== Your Cluster Default Configuration

The following notes are provided on your default cluster configuration.

* Ports 7687 (bolt) and 7473 (HTTPS access) are the only ports exposed to the entire internet.
Consider narrowing access to these ports to only your needed networks.
External unencrypted HTTP access is disabled by default.
* Ports 5000, 6000, and 7000 are enabled only for internal network access (`10.0.0.8`), as they are needed for internal cluster communication.

[#next-steps]
== What's Next

* Visit the link:/docs/operations-manual/current/[Neo4j Operations Manual^] for information on how
configure all aspects of your cluster
* Add users and change passwords as necessary
* Consider creating DNS entries to permit addressing your cluster with client applications under a single host name.

[#terminate-cluster]
== Terminating your Cluster

Should you need to, you can tear down the infrastructure created by deleting the entire resource group you created as part of the deployment.

[#azure-resources]
== Questions?

You can ask questions and connect with other people launching Neo4j in the cloud through the https://community.neo4j.com/c/neo4j-graph-platform/cloud[cloud topic on the Community Site^].
