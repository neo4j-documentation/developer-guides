Neo4j Browser provides many interactive guides for learning concepts and tools with Neo4j.
From data import to graph algorithms to working with RDF data, there is likely an interactive browser guide out there to walk through it.

If there isn't one that fits your needs, you can create one and publish it to the community or internally at your company.
For more information on how to do that, check out our guide for link:/developer/guide-create-neo4j-browser-guide/[creating a custom Browser guide].
