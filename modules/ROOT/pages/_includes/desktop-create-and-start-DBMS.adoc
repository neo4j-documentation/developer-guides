In a Neo4j Desktop project, you can create one or more DBMSs.
Next, you will create a local DBMS in a project and start it.

In the project where you want to add the DBMS, click the *Add* button, and then select *Local DBMS*:

This opens a dialog where you will specify the details of the DBMS.
You can use the default name for the DBMS, which is Graph DBMS, but you should name it something that helps to identify the use case for the DBMS.
Here we specify MyDBMS as the name:

You [underline]#must# specify a password for the DBMS so enter a password that you will remember:

Neo4j Desktop will create a DBMS with the default version for Neo4j Desktop.
However, you can select a different version.
Keep in mind that if there is a down arrow shown next to the version, this means that Neo4j Desktop will need to download resources for that particular version of the DBMS. To do this you [underline]#must# be connected to the Internet:

After you have specifed the details for the DBMS you want to create, you click the *Create* button:

image::{img}generic-create_DBMS.png[role="popup-link"]

And here is what you should see after the DBMS is successfully created:

Recall that you cannot have more than one DBMS started.
Provided you have no other DBMSs started in Neo4j Desktop, you can start your newly-created DBMS by hovering to the right of the DBMS name and clicking the *Start* button:

image::{img}generic-start_DBMS.png[role="popup-link"]

The DBMS will take a few seconds to start. After it is started, you should see something like this:

image::{img}generic-DBMS_started.png[role="popup-link"]

After the DBMS is started, you can access it with clients running on your system such as Neo4j Browser, Neo4j Bloom, etc.
In Neo4j Desktop, the DBMS is an Enterprise Server, but it can only be accessed locally.
