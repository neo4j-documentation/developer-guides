When you open Neo4j Desktop for the first time you will see a Neo4j Primer Project with the  Movie Database already started as shown here:

You can use this already-started DBMS if you want to begin learning about using Neo4j and Cypher.
For your development, you typically create one or more projects where a project can contain one or more DBMSs.

Next, you will create a new project in Neo4j Desktop.
You  can only have a single DBMS running, so you must first stop the DBMS that is started by clicking the *Stop* button:

You should now see that there is no active DBMS:

Add a new project by clicking *New* at the top of the sidebar:

image::{img}/generic-create_project.png[role="popup-link"]

This creates a project named *Project*:

You want your projects to be named something that describes the goal of the project.
You can change the name of a project by hovering over the area to the right of the project name and selecting the *Edit* button:

image::{img}/generic-name_project.png[role="popup-link"]

Then you type a name for the project and select the "Check" button to save the name.

image::{img}/generic-change_project_name.png[role="popup-link"]

And here we see the project with the changed name:
