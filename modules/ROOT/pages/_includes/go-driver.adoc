The Neo4j Go driver is *officially supported* by Neo4j and connects to the database using the binary bolt protocol.
It aims to be minimal, while being idiomatic to Go.

=== Module version
Make sure your application has been set up to use go modules (there should be a go.mod file in your application root). Add the driver with:

[source, shell, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v4
----

If you need to pin a specific https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/tags[*4.x* version], you can run this instead:
----
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v4@<4.x tag>
----

where `<4.x tag>` is one of the available tag (e.g.: `v4.2.4`).

[source, go, subs="attributes"]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v{go-driver-version}/neo4j/test-integration/examples_test.go[tag=hello-world,indent=0]
----
