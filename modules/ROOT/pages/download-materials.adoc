Have you taken your first steps with Neo4j? Are you motivated about how graph databases can make your live easier? Driven by the prospect of being to understand how your data is connected, rather than if?

Many of us who have our graph ephiphanies are excited to share our discoveries with our colleagues, acquaintances and members of our technology communities. But as many of us know, creating the content and associated story is easier said then done!
