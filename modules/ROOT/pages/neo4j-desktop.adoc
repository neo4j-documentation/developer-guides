[#what-is-neo4j-desktop]
== What is Neo4j Desktop

Neo4j Desktop is a Developer IDE or Management Environment for Neo4j instances similar to Enterprise Manager, but better.
You can manage as many projects and database servers locally as you like and also connect to remote Neo4j servers.
Neo4j Desktop comes with a free Developer License of Neo4j Enterprise Edition. The Java Runtime is also bundled.

Each database server managed through desktop can be configured, upgraded and maintained through the UI, no command line needed.
You can install popular Neo4j extensions like link:/labs/apoc[APOC^] or the link:/developer/graph-data-science[Graph Data Science^] library with a single click.

Similar to IDE plugins, link:/developer/graph-apps[Graph Apps^] are helper web applications that make interacting with Neo4j easier.
They cover visualization and querying with Neo4j Browser and Bloom, import tools for relational databases, monitoring tools to query log analyzers.

Both Neo4j Desktop as well as Graph Apps offer automatic updates.

Here is a video that shows you how to get started with Neo4j Desktop:

[#desktop-activate]
== Opening Neo4j Desktop for the First Time

If you are opening Neo4j Desktop for the first time, it should ask you to register the software with an activation key.
This activation key is generated when you first download Neo4j Desktop and will be displayed on the download confirmation page.
Keep it somewhere safe.

image::{img}desktop_registration_may2020.jpg[float="right"]

Copy this activation key into the Software registration form and click Activate to continue.

As a new user to Neo4j Desktop, you will be greeted with a project containing the sample database containing https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/movies[Movies and Actors^].

image::{img}generic-first_open_desktop.png[role="popup-link"]

This database is already started for you. If for some reason the database is not started, you can start it by hovering to the right of the database name and clicking the Start button.
The sample database is created using a randomly generated password, which is stored within Neo4j Desktop and used by Neo4j Browser to authenticate against the database.

This database has a Browser Guide that introduces you to the database. The database must be started before you open the Browser Guide.

Clicking the Open button for the Sample database will open up the Neo4j Browser with a Browser Guide that will guide you through your first queries on this Neo4j database.

image::{img}start-movie-guide.png[role="popup-link"]

Here is how the Browser Guide appears when you first open it:

image::{img}movie-guide-started.png[role="popup-link"]

Within the Guide, you can navigate through the pages to learn more about accessing this sample database.

[#desktop-navigate]
== Navigation

The left sidebar of Neo4j Desktop shows high-level icons for projects, graph applications, settings, activation keys, and Neo4j info.
At the top, the folder with a bookmark (image:neo4j-desktop-project-icon.png[width=30]) shows the list of projects you have created.

=== Settings

Application settings can be modified or viewed by clicking the gear towards the bottom of the left-side menu in Neo4j Desktop (image:neo4j-desktop-settings-icon.png[width=30]).
You can modify any of these settings at any time.

The first block is for privacy settings where you can adjust what data is sent back to Neo4j for assistance and future improvements.
The next two sections are where you can configure a proxy or run Neo4j Desktop in offline mode.


[TIP]
====
We do not recommend running Neo4j Desktop in offline mode unless required by your company.
Offline mode prevents software updates from occurring as well as downloading required resources.
====

=== Other sidebar sections

The `DBMS` section shows which versions of the database are used in your projects (if any) and lists the currently set up projects and databases.

Another section, `Graph Apps` enables you to add and integrate graph apps with Neo4j.

In addition, you can access the javascript console of an application for debugging and error reporting through the developer tools.

The `Notification Center` section enables you to update software.

The `Software Keys` section (image:{img}activation_keys_icon.jpg[width=20]) shows the licenses that are attached to this installation in Neo4j Desktop, which includes activation of Desktop itself along with any graph app licenses.

The `About` section (image:{img}neo4j_icon.jpg[width=20]) is information about Neo4j itself and includes links to the main company website, as well as release and license information.

[#desktop-create-project]
=== Creating a Project

include::./_includes/desktop-create-project.adoc[]

To remove the project, hover over the `Project` row in the projects menu and click the trash bin icon that appears on the right side (image:neo4j-desktop-remove-icon.png[width=30]).

[#desktop-create-DBMS]
== Creating a DBMS

A DBMS is a Neo4j Server instance that contains the `system` and `neo4j` databases, but can contain more databases (multi-db feature of Neo4j 4.x Enterprise Edition)

include::./_includes/desktop-create-and-start-DBMS.adoc[]

You have now created y our own DBMS!

[#desktop-manage-dbms]
== Managing the DBMS

After you have created a DBMS you may want to:

* Add a plugin (library) that will be used for the instance.
* Add a file for importing data into a database of the DBMS.
* Open a terminal window for the DBMS.
* Modify runtime settings for the DBMS.
* View log files for the DBMS.
* Reset the password for the DBMS.

[#desktop-add-plugin]
=== Adding a plugin

A plugin is additional functionality that can be enabled for a DBMS. Currently with the latest release of Neo4j Desktop that uses a 4.2.x DBMS,
the following plugins come with Neo4j Desktop that you can install:

* Awesome Procedures for Cypher (APOC)
* Graph Data Science Library
* GraphQL
* Neo4j Streams

If you click the DBMS, a pane should open on the right with the Details, Plugins, and Upgrade tabs. If you do not see this pane on the right, make sure your Neo4j Dekstop window is wider to accomodate this pane.

image::{img}generic-view_plugins.png[role="popup-link"]

You can install or uninstall a plugin from this tab. The version of the plugin must be compatible with the version of the DBMS. Neo4j Desktop will ensure compatibility.
After you install or uninstall a plugin, you must restart the DBMS.

Here we see that we can now access APOC procedures for this DBMS:

image::{img}generic-APOC_installed.png[role="popup-link",width=400]

[#desktop-add-files-for-import]
=== Adding files to import

The default local folder where Cypher expects CSV files when you are importing data is the import folder for the DBMS.
Open a finder window on your system by hovering over the three dots to the right started DBMS and select *Open folder*, and then *Import*:

image::{img}generic-open_import_folder.png[role="popup-link"]

You can copy or move CSV files into this *import* folder. With CSV files here, you can use `LOAD CSV` to import data into your database.

[#desktop-open-terminal]
=== Opening a terminal

You can open a terminal window that will be automatically ready for using your Neo4j DBMS. In a terminal window you can use the command-line tools that are available in your installation such as:

* cypher-shell
* neo4j-admin

To open a terminal window you select the dropdown menu to the right of the Open button and select `Terminal`:

image::{img}generic-open_terminal.png[role="popup-link",width=400]

In the terminal window you can navigate to the `bin` directory to execute the `cypher-shell` or `neo4j-admin` tools.

[#desktop-DBMS-settings]
=== Modifying settings for the DBMS

You can view or modify settings for the DBMS by selecting the dropdown menu to the right of the Open button and select `Settings`.
The current settings for the DBMS are displayed. You can modify them. In most cases the DBMS will need to be restarted.

image::{img}generic-edit_DBMS_settings.png[role="popup-link"]


[#desktop-view-logs]
==== Viewing logs

There are different types of log files associates with a DBMS.
The main log file can be viewed by selecting the dropdown menu to the right of the Open button and select `Logs`.
Here is the *neo4j.log* file:

image::{img}generic-view_logs.png[role="popup-link"]

There are other log files that can be used by the Neo4j DBMS. These files are all found in the *logs* directory.

[#desktop-reset-password]
=== Resetting the DBMS password

You may have forgotten or want to change the password for the DBMS.
You can reset it by clicking the DBMS, where a pane should open on the right with the Details, Plugins, and Upgrade tabs.
If you do not see this pane on the right, make sure your Neo4j Desktop window is wider to accommodate this pane.

If you scroll to the bottom of the Details pane, you can reset the password for the DBMS:

image::{img}generic-reset_password.png[role="popup-link",width=400]
