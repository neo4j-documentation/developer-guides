== The Dataset

The movie database is a traditional dataset for graph databases, similiar to IMDB it contains movies and actors, directors, producers etc.
It could be extended with Genres, Publishers, Ratings and more.

[NOTE]
You find a similar, but smaller dataset in the Neo4j-Browser of your Neo4j installation by entering `:play movie graph` in the commandline.

This dataset was sourced from link:TheMovieDB.org.
Thanks so much to them for allowing us to use it for educational purposes.
It was originally used for the link:/developer/language-guides/spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j] tutorial project Cineasts.

The data model is straightforward:

* (:Movie {title, released, ... })
* (:Person {name, born, ...})
* (:Person)-[:ACTED_IN|:DIRECTED|:PRODUCED]->(:Movie)

=== Download

The dataset consists of 12862 movies, and 50179 people (44943 actors, 6037 directors).

[NOTE]
Make sure to download the correct version of the dataset for your Neo4j installation.

* http://example-data.neo4j.org/files/cineasts_12k_movies_50k_actors_2.1.6.zip[Download for Neo4j 2.1 (12.3 MB)]
* Download for Neo4j 2.2
* Download for Neo4j 2.3

Unzip the dataset after the download and move the `graph.db` folder to your `/path/to/neo4j/data` directory and override the `graph.db` folder that was previously there.

Installation in Detail:

* Stop your Neo4j server with `bin/neo4j stop` or your control app
* Unzip the downloaded file
* Override `graph.db` in `/path/to/neo/data`
* Start the server again with `bin/neo4j start`
* Open the Neo4j Web Interface on http://localhost:7474
* Read about the Cypher Query Language
* Follow the source links for some example Cypher queries

You can also point the neo4j-shell to the extracted directory to run Cypher queries directly:
[source, shell]
----
/path/to/neo/bin/neo4j-shell -path /path/to/graph.db
----

=== Example Queries

include::example$movie-database-queries.txt[]

=== Import Instructions

http://themoviedb.org[TheMovieDB.org] offers a JSON API to access, movies, and their cast.

We use that API with a ruby script to turn each movie-json object into a cypher statement.
Make sure to get an https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api[API-Key] upfront.

[source,ruby]
----
include::example$import-movies.rb[]
----

It outputs the Cypher statements on stdout and can be piped to the neo4j-shell or a file, which then can be read by the neo4j-shell.
