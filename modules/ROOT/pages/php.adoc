[#neo4j-symfony]
== Neo4j Symfony Bundle

To provide a smooth integration between Neo4j and Symfony weâ€™ve created the SymfonyNeo4jBundle.
It wraps the excellent PHP community client by Graphaware and creates a solid Symfony experience.
Thanks to the WebProfiler integration, you will see all your database calls, all the queries and their results, exceptions and statistics.

The bundle also integrates the client events with the Symfony event dispatcher.
It is not opinionated in how you are using Neo4j and using the OGM is optional.
Advanced Neo4j users will have full control over the client and what Cypher gets executed.
