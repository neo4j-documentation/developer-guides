:description: If you are a PHP developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j.

.Goals
[abstract]
{description}
While this guide is not comprehensive it will introduce the different drivers and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/graph-database/[graph database concepts] and the property graph model, have link:/download/[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher-query-language/[Cypher query language]. You should naturally have PHP installed on your machine and link:https://getcomposer.org/[composer ^]for easy installation of the driver.

If you have any questions, you can always find a community member around on the https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Online Community^].

Alternatively, Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its bolt and HTTP APIs. We recommend the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client#roadmap[PHP Client^] for easiest development over bolt and HTTP APIs. You can also directly access the bolt protocol via the https://github.com/stefanak-michal/Bolt[PHP Bolt] library.

[#Client]
== Full client

*Neo4j-php-client* is a client supporting multiple protocols. *Http* and *bolt* are supported, starting from neo4j 3.5 up until the most recent version.

It boasts many features such as multiple connections, transactions functions, authentication and auto-routing. It also integrates with the psalm static analysis tool for complete type safety.

It is being actively developed and has a big readme file on the https://github.com/laudis-technologies/neo4j-php-client[Github page^].
