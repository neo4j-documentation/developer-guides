:description: This guide provides an overview of how to connecting to Neo4j from Python.

.Goals
[abstract]
{description}
While it is not comprehensive, it aims to introduce the available drivers and links to other relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
* You should be familiar with link:/developer/graph-database/[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
* You should have link:/download/[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher-query-language/[Cypher query language].
* We also recommend installing and becoming familiar with both https://pip.pypa.io/[pip^] and https://virtualenv.pypa.io/[virtualenv^] before working on a Python project.

[#neo4j-python]
== Neo4j and Python

image::{img}/python-logo.png[width=300,float="right"]

Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its binary and HTTP APIs.

You can use the official binary driver for Python (neo4j-python-driver) or connect via HTTP with any of our community drivers.

[#python-driver]
== Neo4j Python Driver

include::./_includes/community-driver-notice.adoc[]

For anyone working with https://www.python.org/[Python^], the Neo4j community have contributed a range of driver options.
These range from lightweight to comprehensive driver packages as well as libraries designed for use with web frameworks such as https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^].

While Python 3 is preferred, some drivers still support Python 2, please check with the individual project if you need it.

While we do not provide a specific web framework recommendation, both the lightweight http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask^] and the more comprehensive https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^] frameworks are known to work well.

[#py2neo-lib]
=== Py2neo

image::{img}/py2neo.200x200.png[float="right",width=100]

Py2neo is a client library and comprehensive toolkit for working with Neo4j from within Python applications and from the command line.
It has been carefully designed to be easy and intuitive to use.
