[#neo4j-python]
== Neo4j and Python

image::{img}python-logo.png[width=300,float="right"]

Neo4j provides drivers which allow you to make a connection to the database and develop applications
which create, read, update, and delete information from the graph.

=== link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-python/?ref=guides[Building Neo4j Applications with Python^]

In this free course, we walk through the steps to integrate Neo4j into your Python projects.
You will learn about the Neo4j Python Driver, how sessions and transactions work and how to query Neo4j from an existing application.

[#python-driver]
== Neo4j Python Driver

include::./_includes/python-driver.adoc[]

include::./_includes/sample_project.adoc[]

include::./_includes/community-driver-notice.adoc[]

For anyone working with https://www.python.org/[Python^], the Neo4j community have contributed a range of driver options.
These range from lightweight to comprehensive driver packages as well as libraries designed for use with web frameworks such as https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^].

While Python 3 is preferred, some drivers still support Python 2, please check with the individual project if you need it.

While we do not provide a specific web framework recommendation, both the lightweight http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask^] and the more comprehensive https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^] frameworks are known to work well.
