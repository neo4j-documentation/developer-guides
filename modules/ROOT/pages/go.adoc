[#golang-bolt]
=== Golang Neo4J Bolt Driver

This implementation attempts to follow the best practices as per the Bolt specification, but also implements compatibility with Golang's `sql.driver` interface.

It is recommended that you use the Neo4j Bolt-specific interfaces if possible.
The implementation is more efficient and can more closely support the Neo4j Bolt feature set.

Features

* Neo4j Bolt low-level binary protocol support
* Message Pipelining for high concurrency
* Connection Pooling
* TLS support
* Compatible with sql.driver

=== CQ

A database/sql implementation for Cypher inspired by the http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/[database/sql^] package which provides idiomatic go database access.
Cypher is close enough to SQL that it seems to fit pretty well in the database/sql implementation.
