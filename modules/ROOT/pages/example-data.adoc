.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be comfortable installing Neo4j (Desktop, Docker) or using an instance in the cloud (Aura, Sandbox).

[#data-sets]
== Datasets

For getting started with using Neo4j it's helpful to use example datasets relevant to your domain and use-cases.
For each we want to provide a description, the graph model and some use-case queries.

[TIP]
Have fun, and provide us feedback for this page or create a GitHub issue in the linked repositories.

[#built-in-examples]
== Built-In Examples

Neo4j Browser comes with two built-in examples, which you can create and explore using interactive slideshows.

The *"Movies"* example, is launched via the `:play movie-graph` command and contains a small graph of movies and people related to those movies as actors, directors, producers etc.

image::{img}browser-example-guides-movies.png[link=https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-neo4j-browser/#_built_in_guides]

The *"Northwind"* example, is run via `:play northwind-graph` and contains an traditional retail-system with products, orders, customers, suppliers and employees.
It walks you through the import of the data and incrementally complex queries using the available data.

image::{img}browser-example-guides-northwind.png[link=https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-neo4j-browser/#_built_in_guides]

[#neo4j-sandbox]
== Neo4j Sandboxes

To explore a wide variety of datasets in an *online setup* without a local installation, you can use the link:/sandbox/?ref=developer-ex-data[Neo4j sandbox^].

Each sandbox is available for at least 3 days after creation and can also be remotely accessed from applications using any Neo4j driver.

image::{img}neo4j-sandboxes.png[link=https://neo4j.com/sandbox/?ref=developer-ex-data-img]

Except for the "blank" sandbox, all other sandboxes come prepopulated with the domain data and focus on use-case specific queries.

All Sandboxes provide access to Neo4j Browser, Neo4j Bloom, APOC, Graph Data Science, neosemantics (n10s) and a GraphQL integration.

=== Sandbox Dataset GitHub Repositories

The data, browser guide, code examples (JavaScript, Java, Python, Go, C#), Cypher queries, Bloom perspectives for each Sandbox are all available in https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples[GitHub repositories^]

The use-cases range from

* https://sandbox.neo4j.com?usecase=recommendations[movie recommendations^] (https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations[Repo])
* https://sandbox.neo4j.com?usecase=network-management[network management^] (https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/network-management[Repo])
* https://sandbox.neo4j.com?usecase=icij-paradise-papers[investigative data from the ICIJ (Panama Papers)^] (https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/icij-paradise-papers[Repo])
* https://sandbox.neo4j.com?usecase=pole[crime investigation^] (https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/pole[Repo])
* https://sandbox.neo4j.com?usecase=twitter-v2[social networks^] optionally using your own Twitter account (https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/twitter[Repo]).

// ,lines=0..-5

[#guide-examples]
== Other Guide Examples

Other examples that you can quickly run within your own Neo4j Browser are:

* `:play got` Game of Thrones Interactions
* `:play nasa` NASA knowledge graph example
* `:play ukcompanies` UK company registration, property ownership, political donations
* `:play stackoverflow` Stack Overflow users, tags and Q&A data
* `:play recipes` BBC Good Foods recipe data
* `:play listings` Airbnb listings data
* `:play football_transfers` Football (Soccer) transfer data
// :play twitter-neo4j-stream
// `:play life-science-import` drug and genome data import and repurposing examples

[#graph-gallery]
== Graph Gallery

Even broader is the selection of graph examples that have been *provided by Neo4j users*.

NOTE: Disclaimer: These examples are not curated and might not always represent the best graph data model.

You can find a featured selection grouped by industry and use case at https://neo4j.com/graphgists

image::{img}neo4j-graphgists.png[link=https://neo4j.com/graphgists]

Those examples are presented in a more long-form style that also discusses data modeling and use an temporary Neo4j store in the background.

To execute these examples within your Neo4j Desktop, install the *"Graph Gallery"* app from: https://install.graphapp.io

Then you can search and browse all available examples locally and run them against your *local* databases.

image::{img}graph-examples.png[link=https://install.graphapp.io]

If you want to submit your own graph data model example, please head to https://portal.graphgist.org to have a look at even more (non-featured) examples and create your own entries.

[#means-data-import]
== Means of Data Import

[#load-data-source]
=== Loading Data from Source Data

The most reliable way to get a dataset into Neo4j is to import it from the raw sources.
Then you are independent of database versions, which you otherwise might have to upgrade.
That's why we provided raw data (CSV, JSON, XML) for several of the datasets, accompanied by import scripts in Cypher.

You could run the Cypher script using a command-line client like `cypher-shell`.

// image::{img}cypher-import-shell.png[]

.Run Cypher Shell from the "Terminal" of your Graph Database in Neo4j Desktop
[source, shell]
----
./bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p "password" -f import-file.cypher
----

You can also drag and drop or paste the script into Neo4j Browser (check that "multi-statement editor" is enabled in the settings) and run it from there.

image::{img}cypher-import-browser.png[]

CSV data can be imported using either link:https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/#import-load-csv[`LOAD CSV` clause in Cypher^] or https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tutorial/neo4j-admin-import/[`neo4j-admin import` for initial bulk imports^] of large datasets.

For loading JSON, XML, XLS etc. you need to have the https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc[APOC^] utility library installed, which comes with a https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.2/import/[number of procedures for importing data^] also from other databases.

[#load-db-copy]
=== Using a dump of a Neo4j database

Other datasets are provided as dump of a Neo4j datastore.

.Community Edition (replace the default database)
1. Please stop your Neo4j server
2. Then you can import the file using the `./bin/neo4j-admin load  --force true --from file.dump` command.
3. Start the Neo4j server

.Enterprise Edition (also Neo4j Desktop)
1. Import the file using the `./bin/neo4j-admin load  --force true --from file.dump --database <dbname>` command.
2. Make the new database known to the system database with `CREATE DATABASE dbname` which will also automatically start it


[WARNING]
The Neo4j version of some of the datasets  might be older than your Neo4j version.
Then you might need to configure Neo4j to upgrade your database automatically, by setting `dbms.allow_upgrade=true` in your Neo4j settings, or directly in `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`

[#example-datasets]
== Large Data Dumps

// export URL=example-data.neo4j.org/3.0-datasets/; aws s3 ls s3://${URL} | awk -v url=$URL '{ split($4,a,".");print "* http://" url $4 "[" a[1] " (" int($3/1024/1024) "MB)]"}'

[#stack-overflow]
=== Stack Overflow

This is a graph-import of the Stack Overflow archive with 16.4M questions, 52k tags and 8.9M users (http://example-data.neo4j.org/so.dump[Stack Overflow Dump (6.2GB)]).
This graph is pretty big, for best full scale querying you'd need a page-cache and heap of

Here is an https://towardsdatascience.com/tagoverflow-correlating-tags-in-stackoverflow-66e2b0e1117b[article explaining the data model] and some exploratory analysis we ran on the data.

The database is also available as in the <<demo-server,Demo Server>> as outlined above
