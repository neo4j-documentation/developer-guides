It helps if you have read the section on link:/developer/graph-database/[graph databases], as well as have downloaded and are familiar with link:/developer/neo4j-desktop/[Neo4j Desktop].

[#what-are-graphapps]
== What are Graph Apps?

A Graph app is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with HTML and JavaScript which interact with Neo4j databases through link:/desktop/[Neo4j Desktop^].
They can be developed by anyone - community members, partners, enterprises, and more - and are a convenient way of trying out ideas or building useful tools with Neo4j databases.
A developer could take an existing SPA and package it into a graph app or start from scratch with a new idea.

[#available-graphapps]
== Available Graph Apps

A full list of published graph apps for Neo4j is provided on our https://install.graphapp.io/[Graph App Gallery^].
You can also open the Graph App Gallery within Neo4j Desktop by navigating to the **Graph Apps Pane** using the four square icon on the left hand menu.



=== Installation

Each Graph App in the https://install.graphapp.io/[Graph App Gallery^] has it's own installation link.
Provided you have link:/desktop/[Neo4j Desktop^] installed, the Graph App Gallery will open a deep-link into Neo4j Desktop instructing it to download and install the Graph App.


==== Installation from Package Managers & NPM

You can instruct Neo4j Desktop to install a Graph App by using a deep link with the `neo4j-desktop://` scheme.  The URL to the Graph App should be passed as a URL parameter.  The full link is: `neo4j-desktop://graphapps/install?url=[URL to NPM style repository Remote Graph App]`.

For example, to install GraphQL Architect, you could use the following URL:

[source]
neo4j-desktop://graphapps/install?url=https://registry.npmjs.org/@grandstack/graphql-architect


==== Installing a Remote Graph App

Any website can be installed as a Graph App, these are referred to as **Remote Graph Apps**.
An example is link:/labs/halin[Halin^], which can either be installed as a standalone Graph App or as a Remote Graph App which is hosted remotely at link:https://halin.graphapp.io[halin.graphapp.io].

To install a Remote Graph App, enter the URL of the Graph App into the **File or URL** input box at the bottom of the Graph Apps Pane.
Once installed you should receive a confirmation message.
