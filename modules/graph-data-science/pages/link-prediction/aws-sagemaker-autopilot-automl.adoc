:description: This guide explains how to solve a link prediction problem using Neo4j GDSL and the AWS SageMaker Autopilot AutoML tool.

.Goals
[abstract]
In this guide, we will learn how to solve a link prediction problem using the AWS SageMaker Autopilot AutoML tool and the Graph Data Science Library.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
Please have link:/download[Neo4j^] (version 4.0 or later) and the link:/download-center/#algorithms[Graph Data Science Library^] downloaded and installed.
You will also need to have an AWS account.

Link Prediction techniques are used to predict future or missing links in graphs.
In this guide we're going to use these techniques predict future co-authorships using AWS SageMaker Autopilot and link prediction algorithms from the Graph Data Science Library.

[NOTE]
====
The code examples used in this guide can be found in the https://github.com/neo4j-examples/link-prediction[neo4j-examples/link-prediction^] GitHub repository.
For background reading on link prediction, see the xref:link-prediction/index.adoc[] guide.

[#install-dependencies]
== Install Dependencies

We're going to use several Python libraries in this guide, so let's get those installed by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
pip install pandas sagemaker
----

[#citation-graph]
== Citation Graph

We'll be using data from the https://aminer.org/citation[DBLP Citation Network^], which includes citation data from various academic sources.
The dataset doesn’t contain relationships between authors describing their collaborations, but we can infer them based on finding articles authored by multiple people.

[#train-test-features]
== Train and test datasets

We're going to use the train and test DataFrames that we created in the xref:graph-data-science:link-prediction/scikit-learn.adoc[Link Prediction with scikit-learn] developer guide.
In that guide we split the citation graph into test and train sub graphs and engineered features using graph algorithms.

We can import those DataFrames from CSV files using the following code:

[source,python]
----
include::example$link-prediction/py/05_SageMaker.py[tag="load-csv-files"]
----

And now let's have a look at the features that we're going to be working with:
