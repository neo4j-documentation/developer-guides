[#cypher-keywords]
== Cypher Keywords

Just like with most programming languages, there are a few words in Cypher reserved for specific actions in parts of a query.
We need to be able to create, read, update, or delete data in Neo4j, and keywords help us accomplish that functionality.
Let us look more in detail at two common keywords (more will be covered in upcoming guides).

=== MATCH

The `MATCH` keyword in Cypher is what searches for an existing node, relationship, label, property, or pattern in the database.
If you are familiar with SQL, `MATCH` works pretty much like `SELECT` in SQL.

You can find all node labels in the database, search for a particular node, find all the nodes with a particular relationship, look for patterns of nodes and relationships, and much more using `MATCH`.

=== RETURN

The `RETURN` keyword in Cypher specifies what values or results you might want to return from a Cypher query.
You can tell Cypher to return nodes, relationships, node and relationship properties, or patterns in your query results.
`RETURN` is not required when doing write procedures, but is needed for reads.

The node and relationship variables we discussed earlier become important when using `RETURN`.
In order to bring back nodes, relationships, properties, or patterns, you need to have variables specified in your `MATCH` clause for the data you want to return.

[#cypher-examples]
== Cypher Examples

Let us look at some examples of the syntax we have learned so far using `MATCH` and `RETURN` keywords.
Each example will start with an explanation of what we are trying to achieve and have an image below of the results of the query run in Neo4j Browser.

* *Example 1:* Find the labeled `Person` nodes in the graph.
Note that we must use a variable like `p` for the `Person` node if we want retrieve the node in the `RETURN` clause.

[source, cypher, role=runnable editable graph]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p
LIMIT 1
----

// image::{img}cypher_example1_labelvar.jpg[role="popup-link"]


* *Example 2:* Find `Person` nodes in the graph that have a name of 'Tom Hanks'.
Remember that we can name our variable anything we want, as long as we reference that same name later.

[source, cypher, role=runnable editable graph]
----
MATCH (tom:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
RETURN tom
----

// image::{img}cypher_example2_labelprop.jpg[role="popup-link"]


* *Example 3:* Find which `Movie`s Tom Hanks has directed.

Explanation: we know we need to find Tom Hanks' `Person` node, and we need to find the `Movie` nodes he is connected to.
To do that, we need to follow the `DIRECTED` relationship from Tom Hanks' `Person` node to the `Movie` node.
We have also specified a label of `Movie` so that the query will only look at nodes with that label.
Since we only care about returning the movie in this query, we need to give that node a variable (`movie`) but do not need to give variables for the `Person` node or `DIRECTED` relationship.

[source, cypher, role=runnable editable graph]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie)
RETURN movie
----

// image::{img}cypher_example3_returnnode.jpg[role="popup-link"]


* *Example 4:* Find which `Movie` Tom Hanks has directed, but this time, return only the title of the movie.

Explanation: this query is very similar to Example 3.
Example 3 returned the entire `Movie` node with all its properties.
For this example, we still need to find Tom's movies, but now we only care about their titles.
We will need to access the node's `title` property using the syntax `variable.property` to return the name value.

[source, cypher, role=runnable editable]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title
----

// image::{img}cypher_example4_returnprop.jpg[role="popup-link"]

[#cypher-aliases]
== Aliasing Return Values

Not all properties are simple like our `movie.title` example above.
Some properties have poor names due to property length, multi-word descriptions, developer jargon, and other shortcuts.
These naming conventions can be difficult to read, especially if they end up on reports and other user-facing interfaces.

.Poorly-named Properties
[source,cypher,role=runnable]
----
//poorly-named property
MATCH (tom:Person {name:'Tom Hanks'})-[rel:DIRECTED]-(movie:Movie)
RETURN tom.name, tom.born, movie.title, movie.released
----

Just like with SQL, you can rename return results by using the `AS` keyword and aliasing the property with a cleaner name.
We can look at a mocked-up example to list a customer's orders and the number of items in the order.

.Cleaner Results with aliasing
[source,cypher,role=runnable editable]
----
//cleaner printed results with aliasing
MATCH (tom:Person {name:'Tom Hanks'})-[rel:DIRECTED]-(movie:Movie)
RETURN tom.name AS name, tom.born AS `Year Born`, movie.title AS title, movie.released AS `Year Released`
----

// .Results Without Aliases:
// image:{img}cypher_without_aliases.jpg[role="popup-link"]

// .Results With Aliases:
// image:{img}cypher_with_aliases.jpg[role="popup-link"]

[NOTE]
--
You can specify return aliases that have spaces by using the backtick character before and after the alias (movie.released AS `Year Released`).
If you do not have an alias that contains spaces, then you do not need to use backticks.

== Code Challenge

Now that you know the basics, use the parts below to build a cypher statement to to find the `title` and year of `release` for every `:Movie` that Tom Hanks has `:DIRECTED`.
Click the parts to add them in order and once you are done, click **Run Query** to see whether you have got it right.
You can click any part of the query inside the code block to remove it.

[source,cypher]
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Tom Hanks"})-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie) RETURN m.title, m.released

[#cypher-next-steps]
== Next Steps

Now that you know how to write nodes, relationships, properties, and patterns in Cypher for reading existing data, you can begin exploring data that exists in a Neo4j database.
We will look at more `MATCH` capabilities in an upcoming guide, as well as how to write Cypher for create, update, and delete operations with your data.
