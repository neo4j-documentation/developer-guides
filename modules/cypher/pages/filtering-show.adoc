[#show-commands]
== SHOW commands in Neo4j 4.0

In Neo4j 4.0, we introduced these commands to help you manage a Neo4j instance and users.
Note that in 4.0, these commands had to be issued from the system database.

----
SHOW DATABASES
SHOW DATABASE [DEFAULT DATABASE] | [<database-name>]
----

----
SHOW USERS
SHOW USER <user-name>
----

----
SHOW [ALL | POPULATED] ROLES [WITH USERS}
SHOW ROLE <role-name> PRIVILEGES
----

----
SHOW PRIVILEGES
----

[#yield-for-show-commands]
== Using SHOW commands in Neo4j 4.1

In 4.1, these commands have been enhanced so you can filter results to display.
You can specify specific columns that you want to return or filter.
In addition, you need not run these commands using the system database.

For example:

----
SHOW DATABASES
YIELD name, currentStatus
WHERE name CONTAINS 'test' AND currentStatus = 'online';
----

image::show-databases-example.jpg[Using SHOW DATABASES, link="{imagesdir}/show-databases-example.jpg",role="popup-link"]

Here is another example:

----
SHOW ROLE reader PRIVILEGES
YIELD access, resource, segment, action
WHERE access = 'GRANTED'  AND action = 'match';
----

image::show-roles-example.jpg[Using SHOW ROLES, link="{imagesdir}/show-roles-example.jpg",role="popup-link"]
