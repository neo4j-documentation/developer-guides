[#about-cypher]
Cypher is Neo4j's graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the graph.
It is like SQL for graphs, and was inspired by SQL so it lets you focus on what data you want out of the graph (not how to go get it).  It is the easist graph language to learn by far because of its similarity to other languages, and intuitiveness.

// Note $$->$$ is used as a special escape to prevent asciidoc from replacing -> with arrow in unicode
Cypher is unique because it provides a visual way of matching patterns and relationships.
Cypher uses an ASCII-art type of syntax where `$$(nodes)-[:ARE_CONNECTED_TO]->(otherNodes)$$` using rounded brackets for circular
`(nodes)`, and `$$-[:ARROWS]->$$` for relationships.
When you write a query, you draw a graph pattern through your data.

Neo4j users use Cypher to construct expressive and efficient queries to do any kind of create, read, update, or
delete (CRUD) on their graph, and Cypher is the primary interface for Neo4j.

[IMPORTANT]
Like Neo4j itself, Cypher is open source!  link:http://openCypher.org[The openCypher project^] provides all of the specs needed.
Cypher is backed by a number of companies all of which benefit from cypher.

[#cypher-intro]
== Introduction to Cypher

Once you have an AuraDB database, you can use the `:play cypher` command inside of Neo4j Browser to get started.

Neo4j's developer pages cover the basics of the language, which you can explore by topic area below, starting with basic material, and building up towards more complex material.

[#recommendation-engine]
== Tutorial: Build a Recommendation Engine

With Cypher structure and syntax covered in the sections above, you can dive into building your own recommendation engine to use graph data and Cypher to recommend movies, colleagues, cuisines, and more.

xref:guide-build-a-recommendation-engine.adoc[Tutorial: Build a Recommendation Engine,role=more information] will walk through using queries and filtering that takes advantage of the relationships in a graph in order to lend insight into habits and hidden connections and provide valuable recommendations.
