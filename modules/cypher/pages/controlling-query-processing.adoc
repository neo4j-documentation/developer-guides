[#cypher-example]
== Recap: Our Example Graph

All of our examples will continue with the graph example we have been using in the previous guides.
Below is an image of the graph to familiarize yourself with the nodes and relationships used throughout this page.

[#cypher-aggregate]
== Aggregation in Cypher

Helpful aggregation operations, such as calculating averages, sums, percentiles, minimum/maximum, and counts are available in Cypher.
You may find many of these have similar syntax to other query language operations, but Cypher does work slightly differently with aggregation.

In Cypher, you do not need to specify a grouping key.
It implicitly groups by a non-aggregate field in the return clause.
This might seem much easier than more verbose syntax in other languages, but opinions may vary.

[#aggregate-count]
=== Aggregating by Count

Sometimes you only need to return a count of the results found in the database, rather than returning the objects themselves.
The `count()` function in Cypher allows you to count the number of occurences of entities, relationships, or results returned.

There are two different ways you can count return results from your query.
The first is by using `count(n)` to count the number of occurences of `n` and does not include `null` values.
You can specify nodes, relationships, or properties within the parentheses for Cypher to count.
The second way to count results is with `count({empty}*)`, which counts the number of result rows returned (including those with `null` values).

In our data set, some of our `Person` nodes have a Twitter handle, but others do not.
If we run the first example query below, you will see that we have the `twitter` property has a value for four people and is `null` for the other five people.
The second and third queries show how to use the different count options.

[source, cypher]
----
//Query1: see the list of Twitter handle values for Person nodes
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN p.twitter

//Query2: count on the Person nodes (does not include null values)
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN count(p.twitter)

//Query3: count on the Person nodes
MATCH (p:Person)
RETURN count(*)
----

[#aggregate-collect]
=== Aggregating Values

The `collect()` function in Cypher gives you the capability to aggregate values into a list.
You can use this to group a set of values based on a particular starting node, relationship, property.

For instance, if we listed each person in our example data with each of their friends (see the Cypher below), you would see duplicate names in the left column because each `Person` might have multiple friends, and you need a result for each relationship from the starting person.
To aggregate all of a person's friends by the starting person, you can use `collect()`.
This will group the friend values by the non-aggregate field (in our case, `p.name`).

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]->(friend:Person)
RETURN p.name, collect(friend.name) AS friend
----

image::{img}/cypher_agg_collect.jpg[role="popup-link"]

[#aggregate-size]
=== Counting Values in a List

If you have a list of values, you can also find the number of items in that list or calculate the size of an expression using the `size()` function.
The examples below return the number of items or patterns found.

[source, cypher]
----
//Query5: find number of items in collected list
MATCH (p:Person)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]->(friend:Person)
RETURN p.name, size(collect(friend.name)) AS numberOfFriends

//Query6: find number of friends who have other friends
MATCH (p:Person)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]->(friend:Person)
WHERE size((friend)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]-(:Person)) > 1
RETURN p.name, collect(friend.name) AS friends, size((friend)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]-(:Person)) AS numberOfFoFs

[#cypher-results-output]
== Manipulating Results and Output

Results from a query may only show part of the answer you were looking for in the data or may not be in the best format for easily viewing and understanding.
This is where capabilities to link multiple queries together or to sort or limit the output can help you avoid sifting through the results manually to find value.

In the next few paragraphs, we will show how to use certain clauses and keywords to help you write queries to fully answer your data questions and format the results in a way that is simple and quickly valuable.

[#results-with]
=== Chaining Queries Together

The syntax for the queries above might look a bit intimidating, but there are better ways to write it.
One of those ways is to use the `WITH` clause to pass values from one section of a query to another.
This allows you to execute some intermediate calculations or operations within your query to use later.

You must specify the variables in the `WITH` clause that you want to use later.
Only those variables will be passed to the next part of the query.
There are a variety of ways to use this functionality (e.g. count, collect, filter, limit results), but we will show a couple, including a cleaner version of our `size()` query from above.
For more information and ways to use `WITH`, check out the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/with/[Cypher Manual section^].

[source, cypher]
----
//Query7: find and list the technologies people like
MATCH (a:Person)-[r:LIKES]-(t:Technology)
WITH a.name AS name, collect(t.type) AS technologies
RETURN name, technologies

//Query8: find number of friends who have other friends - cleaner Query6
MATCH (p:Person)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]->(friend:Person)
WITH p, collect(friend.name) AS friendsList, size((friend)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]-(:Person)) AS numberOfFoFs
WHERE numberOfFoFs > 1
RETURN p.name, friendsList, numberOfFoFs
----

.Query7 Results:
image:{img}/cypher_results_with.jpg[role="popup-link"]

.Query8 Results:
image:{img}/cypher_results_with_filter.jpg[role="popup-link"]

In the first query, we pass the `Person` name, and a collected list of the `Technology` types.
Only these items can be referenced in the `RETURN` clause.
We cannot use the relationship (`r`) or even the `Person` birthdate because we did not pass those values along.

In the second query, we can only reference `p` and any of its properties (name, birthdate, yrsExperience, twitter), the collection of friends (as a whole, not each value), and the number of friend-of-friends.
Since we passed those values in the `WITH` clause, we can use those in our `WHERE` or `RETURN` clauses.

`WITH` requires all values passed to have a variable (if they do not already have one).
Our `Person` nodes were given a variable (`p`) in the `MATCH` clause, so we do not need to assign a variable there.

[NOTE]
--
`WITH` is also very helpful for setting up parameters before the query.
Often useful for parameter keys, url strings, and other query variables when importing data.

[source,cypher]
----
//find people with 2-6 years of experience
WITH 2 AS experienceMin, 6 AS experienceMax
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE experienceMin <= p.yrsExperience <= experienceMax
RETURN p
----

[#results-unwind]
=== Looping through List Values

If you have a list that you want to inspect or separate the values, Cypher offers the `UNWIND` clause.
This does the opposite of `collect()` and separates a list into individual values on separate rows.

Using `UNWIND` is frequently used for looping through JSON and XML objects when importing data, as well as everyday arrays and other types of lists.
Let us look at a couple of examples where we assume that the technologies someone likes also mean they have some experience with each one.
We are interested in hiring people who are familiar with `Graphs` or `Query Languages`, so we can write a query to find people to interview.

[source, cypher]
----
//Query9: for a list of techRequirements, look for people who have each skill
WITH ['Graphs','Query Languages'] AS techRequirements
UNWIND techRequirements AS technology
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:LIKES]-(t:Technology {type: technology})
RETURN t.type, collect(p.name) AS potentialCandidates

//Query10: for numbers in a list, find candidates who have that many years of experience
WITH [4, 5, 6, 7] AS experienceRange
UNWIND experienceRange AS number
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.yearsExp = number
RETURN p.name, p.yearsExp
----

.Query9 Results:
image:{img}/cypher_results_unwind_strList.jpg[role="popup-link"]

.Query10 Results:
image:{img}/cypher_results_unwind_numList.jpg[role="popup-link"]

[#results-ordering]
=== Ordering Results

Our list of potential hiring candidates from our last example might be more useful if we could order the candidates by most or least experience.
Or perhaps we want to rank all of our people by age.

The `ORDER BY` keyword will sort the results based on the value you specify and in ascending or descending order (ascending is default).
Let's use the same queries from our example with `UNWIND` and see how we can order our candidates.

[source, cypher]
----
//Query11: for a list of techRequirements, look for people who have each skill - ordered Query9
WITH ['Graphs','Query Languages'] AS techRequirements
UNWIND techRequirements AS technology
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:LIKES]-(t:Technology {type: technology})
WITH t.type AS technology, p.name AS personName
ORDER BY technology, personName
RETURN technology, collect(personName) AS potentialCandidates

//Query12: for numbers in a list, find candidates who have that many years of experience - ordered Query10
WITH [4, 5, 6, 7] AS experienceRange
UNWIND experienceRange AS number
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.yearsExp = number
RETURN p.name, p.yearsExp ORDER BY p.yearsExp DESC
----

.Query11 Results:
image:{img}/cypher_results_order_names.jpg[role="popup-link"]

.Query12 Results:
image:{img}/cypher_results_order_experience.jpg[role="popup-link"]

Notice that our first query has to order by `Person` name before collecting the values into a list.
If you do not sort first (put the `ORDER BY` after the `RETURN`), you will sort based on the size of the list and not by the first letter of the values in the list.
We also sort on two values - technology, then person.
This allows us to sort our technology so that all the persons that like a technology are listed together.

You can try out the difference in sorting by both values or one value by running these queries:

[source,cypher]
--
//only sorted by person's name in alphabetical order
WITH ['Graphs','Query Languages'] AS techRequirements
UNWIND techRequirements AS technology
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:LIKES]-(t:Technology {type: technology})
WITH t.type AS technology, p.name AS personName
ORDER BY personName
RETURN technology, personName

//only sorted by technology (person names are out of order)
WITH ['Graphs','Query Languages'] AS techRequirements
UNWIND techRequirements AS technology
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:LIKES]-(t:Technology {type: technology})
WITH t.type AS technology, p.name AS personName
ORDER BY technology
RETURN technology, personName

//sorted by technology, then by person's name
WITH ['Graphs','Query Languages'] AS techRequirements
UNWIND techRequirements AS technology
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:LIKES]-(t:Technology {type: technology})
WITH t.type AS technology, p.name AS personName
ORDER BY technology, personName
RETURN technology, personName
--

[#results-distinct]
=== Returning Unique Results

Over the last couple of guides, there have been a few queries that have returned duplicate results due to multiple paths to the node or a node met multiple criteria.
This redundancy can clutter results and make sifting through a long list difficult to find what you need.

To trim out duplicate entities, we can use the `DISTINCT` keyword.
We will use past examples from queries, as well as a query from a previous page to show how to use this to remove repetitive results.

[source, cypher]
----
//Query13: find people who have a twitter or like graphs or query languages
MATCH (user:Person)
WHERE user.twitter IS NOT null
WITH user
MATCH (user)-[:LIKES]-(t:Technology)
WHERE t.type IN ['Graphs','Query Languages']
RETURN DISTINCT user.name
----

.Query13 Results:
image:{img}/cypher_results_distinct_user.jpg[role="popup-link"]

For Query13, our use case is that we are launching a new Twitter account for tips and tricks on Cypher, and we want to notify users who have a Twitter account and who like graphs or query languages.
The first two lines of the query look for `Person` nodes who have a Twitter handle.
Then, we use `WITH` to pass those users over to the next `MATCH`, where we find out if the person likes graphs or query languages.
Notice that running this statement without the `DISTINCT` keyword will result in "Melissa" shown twice.
This is because she likes graphs, and she also likes query languages.
When we use `DISTINCT`, we only retrieve unique users.

[#results-limit]
=== Limiting Number of Results

There are times where you want a sampling set or you only want to pull so many results to update or process at a time.
The `LIMIT` keyword takes the output of the query and limits the volume returned based on the number you specify.

For instance, we can find each person's number of friends in our graph.
If our graph were thousands or millions of nodes and relationships, the number of results returned would be massive.
What if we only cared about the top 3 people who had the most friends?
Let's write a query for that!

[source, cypher]
----
//Query14: find the top 3 people who have the most friends
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]-(other:Person)
RETURN p.name, count(other.name) AS numberOfFriends
ORDER BY numberOfFriends DESC
LIMIT 3
----

image::{img}/cypher_results_limit.jpg[role="popup-link"]

Our query pulls persons and the friends they are connected to and returns the person name and count of their friends.
We could run just that much of the query and return a messy list of names and friend counts, but we probably want to order the list based on the number of friends each person has starting with the biggest number at the top (`DESC`).
You could also run that much of the query to see the friends and counts all in order, but we only want to pull the top 3 people with the most friends.
The `LIMIT` pulls the top results from our ordered list.

[TIP]
--
Try mixing up the query by removing the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` lines and then add each one separately.
Notice that only removing the `ORDER BY` line pulls the starting 3 values from the list, getting a random sampling of the return results.

[#cypher-next-steps]
=== Next Steps

This guide has shown how to do more with Cypher by combining clauses and keywords for aggregating and returning data.
We have seen how to use functions in Cypher and some of the operations offered.
In the next section, we will learn how to maintain data integrity by using constraints and increase query performance with indexes.
