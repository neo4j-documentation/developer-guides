From there, they are synced up to the Neo4j.com server once an hour, on the hour by a cronjob.

=== Images

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not store any images in this repository.
All the images are stored in the https://github.com/neo4j-documentation/assets repository.
====

You can reference an image using the `image:` inline macro, or the `image::` block macro.
It's important to note that the target must be prefixed by `{img}/`. +
For instance, if you want to reference https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/cypher_learning.jpg,
you will need to use the following definition:

[source,adoc]
image::{img}/cypher_learning.jpg[]

== Live Preview

To preview the docs run:

[source,sh]
npm start

This will build a set of HTML files in `build/site` and then serve them through an express server at http://localhost:8000.
The dev script will also listen for changes and automatically rebuild the files automatically.
You'll still need to refresh the page to view the changes.
